It was almost full but there were a handful of tables open. We began to seat ourselves and was told we could sit anywhere. They came and took our drink order pretty quickly and we received them within a few minutes, the girl who delivered our drinks said they would be back to take our order.  I'd say it was almost 10 minutes before they finally came and took out order. I started to wonder who our waitress was because 2 different females took the drink order and delivered them. Finally, one of the females came and took our order, so we must have been there for 15 minutes at least before our food order was taken. 10 minutes had gone by and a lady got sat in the booth next to us. Another 10 minutes later, she got her food before we did. So she got there after us, ordered after us, but received hers before us.

They have nice setting and the establishment seems to be fairly nice, it has got tvs, a bar, a number of tables in various sizes, and a downtown street patio complete with fire heaters for cold nights.

I had the sonoran dog and received two beef tacos that I did not ask for.  The tacos has scraps of beef with cilantro and onion.  They also have the regular styled tacos with tomatoes and lettuce.  The dog was the last one sitting the bin and a bit soggy.  Compared to truck dogs, it does not compare.  The tacos were simply bits of beef with onion and cilantro, nothing impressive and nothing like what is seen in the pictures.

Perhaps, my disappointing experience was due to how the place was packed, had a line out the door by the time I left, and was somewhat loud, but that is no excuse for the terrible eating experience.

The one place you never cut corners is in the food, and that's exactly what they did. 2 of the 3 salsas were so watery that you didn't get any tomatillo or tomato on your chip, at all. The third salsa, the pics de gallo, was the worst chop job I've ever seen in a restaurant. Huge pieces of Serrano pepper with varying sizes of everything else, and in stark contrast to the other 2, completely dried out. 

Without even looking at the menu, I know what I want... #15. That decision hasn't changed for over 10 years. Today I should have made a different choice. I'm not sure if they recently went thru a purveyor change but the quality of everything on the plate was horrible.

For apps, we ordered the takoyaki and fried octopus. The takoyaki are delicious-an order comes with 5 balls that were perfectly cooked and topped with sauces. Takoyaki are little circular doughs with squid in the middle, topped with sauces and squid flakes (?). I definitely recommend this app. As for the fried octopus, it was just fried without sauces on top and came with mayo on the side, but it didn't come with enough mayo to dip the octopus in.

For ramen, I got the red spicy tonkotsu ramen and my SO got the black garlic tonkotsu ramen. For both ramen, the thin noodles were mushy/overcooked and just didn't quite fit with the ramen. That was the flaw with the dishes, and it tasted like the noodles were overcooked in a pot of flour-y water so it wasn't as clean (which explains the mushy feeling). They should use more bouncy noodles for this.

Now let's talk about the broth. The broth is flavorful, but the red chili broth was a bit too spicy for me and covered up the depth of the broth. I prefer the black garlic tonkotsu broth for that reason.

Overall, delicious food and pricing is reasonable. The decor is very nice as well, but screaming kids that were running around didn't make our meal pleasant.",2018-02-24 19:10:30,Raijin Ramen,Tucson,AZ,4.0,594,"Noodles, Japanese, Diners, Restaurants, Ramen",306,4.21,44

Family-owned and -run, there always seem to be the same people (and, sometimes, their kids) behind the counter.
I mainly come for the tamales, tortillas (voted Best of Tucson for a couple of years, and they include one with most combo meals) and flautas. Man, those flautas... They also have what I think is some of the best salsa in the city. Not too spicy, well-balanced, nice color, good consistency... like a fine wine. I'll usually save their salsa cups for use with other Mexican food that I get later.
If you like fake cheese nachos, then this is your place. But do yourself a favor and tell them to hold the onions because, otherwise, you'll find one has exploded in your container and it will take you two days to get the taste out of your mouth.
The best part about this place though is the price: cheap, cheap, cheap! Most of the combos run about $5 and include an entree, rice, beans, one tortilla and a couple of salsa cups. I usually make myself a little bean & rice burro when I'm done with the meal. Good stuff!
I'll only recommend this to some people, if I know that they won't be offended by what a sh*thole this place is. No, honestly, it's a really crappy building.

Literally that's all I can say about this place. I went twice in one weekend! I'm literally obsessed. So where do I begin?

The doughssants! Or cronuts, as some people prefer. How YUMMY. I had the cranberry and coconut one. They're very dense so get one BEFORE your meal bc I could only take one bite out of mine after I finished my grilled cheese. Oh man, that grilled cheese. They have a really unique blend of cheeses and pesto! Now I am not a pesto fan (I know, very strange) but it works great here! But the selling point is the tomato basil soup. Literally the BEST I have ever had and this is my favorite soup so I have tried it everywhere. The second time, I tried the classic breakfast: 2 eggs, any style (I opted for scrambled), country hash (delicious) and toast. This time I had my doughssant beforehand, s'mores flavored -- amazeballs. 

The space is very comfortable and beautifully decorated. The staff is extremely friendly always checking in with you and making light-hearted and sincere conversation. 

There is a wait to be seated. But you just have to stick it out because you don't want to miss out on this new restaurant. 

I'll be back when they get their liquor license business straightened out so I can sip on a mimosa while I enjoy my grilled cheese.",2014-05-07 20:31:51,Prep & Pastry,Tucson,AZ,4.5,2126,"Restaurants, Cocktail Bars, Bars, Comfort Food, American (New), Sandwiches, Nightlife, Breakfast & Brunch",186,4.02,2

Formalities first--why can't there be some ambiance at Indian restaurants.  I know I'm painting with broad strokes here, but it seems like outside of NYC, no Indian restaurant in the US can get creative with their dining space.  Not sure why that is, but whatever.

Delicious, although I think next time I'll stick with regular, at almost half the cost.  We also got some Finger Paneer, little spiced fried cubes of cheese.  These were denser than typical Paneer.  The cheese was slightly bland, but the spices were good.  Overall, an enjoyable start to the meal.  I also had a lemonade, which may have been made fresh.  Regardless, it was tasty.

We sat at the small 12 person bar and it took awhile for someone to take our drink order as there was only one bartender on a Saturday night. About 5-6 servers did say hi to us though. Drinks were fine. Apps came out which was the shrimp cocktail and meatballs. Meatballs were under cooked shrimp cocktail was fine. I ordered the chefs cut 20oz bone in ribeye with a chili rub and the wife ordered the filet with one of their toppings of cheese and peppers. The ribeye came out on a cold plate so I sent it back and the manager came over and apologized profusely. The best thing about the wife's filet was the cheese on top. She ordered it med rare and it came out slightly above rare. My steak came back out. I always order mine rare at steak houses and this was like a soggy sponge. Literally couldn't swallow more then 3 bites. The actual cut of steak was one of the worst cuts I've ever seen. The steak was bland. I had to ask multiple times what the rub was because I couldn't taste anything not even salt or pepper.  The beans that came out with the steaks were under cooked and hard. Needless to say I actually didn't eat dinner. The server came and picked up my full plate of steak and threw it away. The chefs cut was 50 bucks. And the total bill was 150 I literally spend that much at least once a week on food so that's not a big deal.  But I would rather spend 150 bucks on double quarter pounders with cheese and have to eat them all in one sitting then eat anything at this place again.

I first came here when they had just opened and was reasonably pleased. They had a few ""new restaurant"" issues to work out, and they did. Now not only is this the closest Chinese restaurant to my house, it is also the best one within at least 5 miles -- and there are a lot of them in that range.

Mae's is not your discount corner Chinese takeout, although you can treat it like one if you want. They don't mind, and their prices are good. But I particularly like their $7-$8 lunch menu which comes with a heaping pile of food, plus rice (steamed or fried) and soup. I'll admit that in at least 10 visits, I've only ever tried the hot & sour soup -- because it's good.

Mae's is friendly. The staff is polite. They learn your name, and say hello if you come in a few times. The food is always quick and they're on top of drink refills. Whether it's lunch or dinner, the portions are huge. I usually end up with two meals. Ultimately, this is a difficult corner for a restaurant and I am glad to see such a good restaurant in the spot.

There were three hostesses when we arrived. I told one of them that I would like a booth for two. One of the girls made a strange look on her face that was either confused, annoyed or both. I couldn't tell between the two expressions. One of the hostesses takes us to a table. I told her I had asked for a booth and I thought that was where we were going because she didn't acknowledge a booth wasn't available. That's when I figured out why one of the girls made a strange look.

** Just a heads up. Caruso's only takes reservations on large parties. Makes sense. But I still would have liked putting my name down to get a booth **

Shortly after we sat down our server came over and introduced himself. Forgot his name. But he was a decent fellow and was very knowledgeable about what was on the menu.

I went in the establishment craving a cold beer. The beer menu lacked variety. It didn't entice me. Instead I ended up ordering a regular iced tea. The glass was huge, which is always great!

** Keep in mind that it can be a little loud in the restaurant sometimes. **

I ended up ordering The Caruso Special, which consisted of a ton of Italian spaghetti specialties. It was delicious! However, I did not feel like I got enough bang for my buck due to the rather small plate size. I wanted more for the $10.75 I put down for my meal.

I was really looking forward to trying this place since people rave about how good the wings are and the great Tuesday night specials. I was coming from work so I arrived a few minutes after my party. The restaurant was half-empty when I arrived and there was no one waiting in line, so I went to my friends' table where their food had just arrived. That's when I was informed by the waitress that I couldn't sit down.

The manager came over and explained the policy of ""no add-ons"" to a table, and the waitress offered me one of the (many) empty tables, where I would be ""allowed"" to sit BY MYSELF, as if I was some kind of pariah. My friends were aghast and we explained that we'd never been to Wings before, and they would never have invited me if they'd known I wouldn't be allowed to join them.

I said I understood the policy for busy nights, and in the future we'd certainly abide by it, but since there was no one waiting for a table it couldn't hurt for me to sit down.

Then the owner came over and very rudely said, ""Fine, you can sit down. But you have to pay full price for wings, no special for you."" He and the manager were glaring at me, totally unsympathetic. I've never felt so insulted, and never before experienced this sort of treatment from a restaurant. It pretty much ruined my day.

Let me start off by saying, the first time my Boyfriend and I went, we were beyond pleased. He got the Philly Cheese steak and I got the Super Gyro, yummmmm! Would of totally given 5 stars at that time, I recommended to EVERYONE to try them out!

2nd time we went, they forgot to put sauce on my Gyro, and cheese on his PhillyCHEESEsteak. Bummer, but we could get over it.

Some people make mistakes right? We decided to give them another try on Monday night, figuring 3rd time is a charm! We went through the drive through (only customers there) ordered our usual, the boyfriend asked for extra onions and peppers on his Cheese steak.

Got home, no cheese, no onions, no peppers on the cheese steak, just meat, and bread. BEYOND disappointing. I bit into my Gyro, the bread was disgustingly stale, I couldn't even eat it. We through our food away without taking more than 2 bites, and ordered pizza.

Dana, our server, patiently explained the specials (a few times over) cause we couldn't make up our minds.  She made sure that the decaf crowd and non-decaf crowd were served correctly.  Also, she gave a more than accurate description of all of the menu items.  She was super welcoming and gracious even though the restaurant was busy.

The place was completely crowded with people waiting outside for a table.  We are vegans and my wife is gluten intolerant.  There was only one item on the menu that we thought we could eat, a vegetarian ramen bowl.  We asked the waiter if we could get gluten free noodles and he said yes so we ordered two of the same for ourselves.  When the bowls arrived a different server said they were not gluten free as the broth was very cloudy.  The person who took our order neglected to tell us the broth was made with wheat and there was nothing else on the menu she could eat, everything had meat or wheat in it.  My wife rejected the order and I ate mine.  Wife had nothing to eat and had to sit there watching me eat mine. 
 
I find it amazing that in a restaurant that advertises itself as selling Japanese food doesn't have any Japanese dishes without meat or wheat.  Japan is or was a rice based food culture with many dishes without meat or fish.  All I can figure is Raijin thinks all Americans want meat and wheat so they design their menu accordingly.

Yoshimatsu restaurant on Campbell Ave. sells many meat and wheat free dishes.  

Raijin is also overpriced for what you get.  Yoshimatsu is cheaper with a lot more variety in the dishes especially ramen dishes.

We ate a a ramen restaurant in downtown San Diego recently that served vegan and gluten free ramen bowls.

I hope Raijin reads this and changes their menu because my ramen bowl was very good with the added garlic hot mixture I ordered as a side and put into my bowl. I would like to return there and give it another try with my wife.

Ambiance = slightly gaudy (unattractive decor and faux flowers), a bit dark without feeling cozy.

Food = disappointingly lacking in flavor and quality.  We ate at the lunch buffet on a Saturday, if it were priced $4.99 instead of $8 I might be less inclined to complain, but it was entirely unexceptional.
I have eaten at many different Indian restaraunts in 5+ countries and multiple cities (most recently Monterey, California where Ambrosia is by far some of the best Indian food I've ever had) and Shere Punjab is one of the worst Indian food restaurants to which I have been.

The naan bread is thin and flavorless, vegetable dishes are significantly lacking in the expected robust flavors and spices, the texture of things (for instance the Saag (spinach dish) seemed as though it came from a can. Blended like baby food. Not a lot of selection.
There were no labels on the food at the buffet.

To say the least, this place did not satisfy my craving (nor my fiance's) for good Indian food and we will not be back.

What a pleasant surprise to find Chopstix and have a really superior experience!  I'm very strictly gluten-free, and they have a real gluten-free menu with about 6 pages, not just a handful of choices.  My husband ordered the orange chicken, the same meal as he had at GM for a true comparison, and raved about how much better it was at Chopstix. I had a lettuce wrap appetizer - almost $2 off during happy hour - consisting of a large mound of various chopped items and about half a head of iceberg lettuce that was basically a full meal in itself, and was incredibly tasty!  I loved it so much I ordered a second one, had about 4-5 more wraps out of it, then had to have them box up the rest.  I hated to have to stop eating, it was so good but I was so full!  I have a medical situation where I have to eat quite a large quantity of food for dinner, and I can't remember ever having an appetizer that was big enough for an entire meal for me - and most of the time, it's rare that I can even eat any appetizers anywhere because of the gluten in them.

So the service was excellent, the food was **outstanding**, and I had a lovely conversation with the manager, whose last day it was.  He has worked with the Southern Arizona Celiac Association, so the employees at Chopstix are extremely well-educated re gluten issues there, which is great because I got glutened just a few doors down from them last week at Native New Yorker, due to poor education on gluten cross-contamination (they served me wings that had been fried in the same oil as stuff with breading.)

Foo foo phooey Italian food and too expense with poor value.  
Cute hostess that greeted us was very friendly, held the door, and seated us immediately.  The service was excellent this time... our dinners came out of the kitchen quickly (although the restaurant was pretty empty except for a large party of 40 for a private affair dining on the patio), our server Jordan was attentive, and the busboy had a great sense of humor and constantly came by to check on us and refill our water glasses, BUT the Alfredo sauce was the worst we've ever had (very disappointing) and the although the homemade sausage was plentiful, just okay if you like Italian sausage (not too spicy... though we would not get it again with Fettuccine Alfredo).  The Cannelloni with chicken had a better tasting sauce, very different for an entree.  BUT overall, the prices on this menu are too high for a la carte or a weekday dinner, and we ordered the least expensive pasta entrees.  Not a vegetable or a small dinner salad are served with the entrees.  No linquini with clam sauce or spaghetti with meatballs, no lasagna, no traditional Italian dishes, and most prices are $15 and up, up, up.  Olive Garden is a much better value with a larger selection of entrees and all the soup or salad you can eat, or even Zona 78 nearby is better (that is probably why they were packed and there was a 45 minute wait for a table).  And the hot bread we were served when we first sat down was just plain weird.... nothing special.  
The chef came out of the kitchen to visit with a celebrity diner (Jim Click) for a long time, and when he passed us (the only other diners in the restaurant in that area) on his way back to the kitchen, he did not even acknowledge us, or say hello, or ask if every thing was okay.

Attracts many types of people and really isn't too far from the Tucson city center. Inside, there is a sky ceiling a laThe Venetian or The Paris in Las Vegas, which have a particularly brighter look inside the casino due to the ""sky-hued"" ceiling. Nice touch.
Blackjack tables have first-deal surrender which seems to be beyond the comprehension of most of the locals who come there to bet $50 to hit a 16 when dealer is showing a 10. I was surrendering a ton and was called out on it by a guy who was losing about 5 times the amount I was ( was actually up due to being able to scavenge some dollars on sure losses). He just didn't get it, and continued hitting crappy hands, successful maybe twice. So that's the thing, at this casino, even the dealers think surrender is a scam, that it messes up cards, but that's wrong if its done in a judicious way. So if you use surrender you will see eyes roll around you, be wary of that. Must not be in the local culture to ""give up"", but instead just lose it all trying to beat a 20. That was my experience anyway. 
They also have Spanish 21 which allows second-deal surrender and up. Pretty interesting, but the minimum bets are almost always higher (greater than $5).

First, the staff everywhere throughout this whole building is NICE NICE NICE. Everyone was beyond gracious and accommodating. I have zero complaints about the staff. They would obviously go out of their way to help anyone. Every bartender, every catering staffer, every hotel desk person, all of them, were SO customer-service oriented. Excellent all around in this area.

The hotel rooms (standard room, paid $99 a night for a Fri. and Sat. in early August) look nice now because they are relatively new but I am not sure they will hold up over time. Very spacious for such a low price and the views are great. 

However, the room walls are paper-thin. I mean PAPER!! I heard everything (even the normal volume conversations -- in detail--- happening in the room next door). My neighbors also had a baby that cried for over 3 hours one day which made napping impossible. I have never heard so much through a hotel room wall before. This is a definite problem and I suspect they hear a lot about it from patrons.

Another review mentioned that the room lighting is bad. This is true. It was nearly impossible to put on makeup even though they had a nice magnification mirror in the bathroom. I tried every spot and couldnt find a place with lighting. I ended up sitting by the window because it was still daylight and holding up my tiny compact on the couch. This is a small but highly frustrating thing for a woman. 

The shower and bathrooms are very nice in the rooms. High quality and the water was warm. I really liked the bathroom. So clean, too!

The TVs are pretty neat because you can check-out on them. 
The free wi-fi was spotty and made me login again on their page over and over. 

The AV in the meeting rooms was cruddy. The mics went in and out and had a lot of interference. However the system is built-in rather than set up like most AV places, so I guess you get what you pay for.

The art in all the conference rooms was gorgeous but it was so cold in all of them that I left my meeting to go defrost. I am not an ""always cold"" person -- lots of other people were frosty too.

Conference room catering was good for the most part. Some things were high quality and delicious, others felt and tasted very mediocre chain-like. Hit and miss.

The pool was always crowded with families. Not a relaxing environment at all. 

Spa service menu was very reasonably priced but not a lot of options. No deep tissue massage?!

I would go back. I want to try the steakhouse.",2014-08-11 20:20:56,Casino Del Sol,Tucson,AZ,3.0,298,"Arts & Entertainment, Hotels & Travel, Casinos, Diners, Restaurants, Mexican, Resorts",37,3.48,2

So I got the manager on the phone and it's clear that she isn't trained in the school of customer service and food allergies. I get it. Allergies suck to have to accommodate--even if it's just to answer a question about ingredients (try living with it). But when it comes down to having a table full of vomit and/or an epi pen getting whipped out, ""Pretty sure..."" just doesn't cut it. Apparently they get their bread/buns from Vero's and therefore in the mystical teleportation device that procures the bread, no ingredient list is a available. But that's okay because some of their employees have worked there for like 10 years and know a lot of ingredients and things. But just not for sure if the buns contain eggs. But I could call Vero's myself to check. *sigh* I tried helping educate this defensive manager about how to better serve a party with food allergies (step 1: don't tell them to call a vendor to check your own product), but what's the point?

But, I will make exceptions for the cool, old school places of my childhood.  This place fits the bill.  Sure, the decor is straight outta 1959, and I could be in someone's living room.  The food here is straight up, no frills, no pretentious airs.   Do wish the wine list had a bit room options, but not a deal breaker.

Had a pre-dinner salad, really liked the Italian dressing, lots of tang from vinegar.  Lasagna for dinner, which turned into two very good sized servings.  The tomato sauce here is great, not sweet, doesn't taste like it's from a can.  Again, reminds me of the old school places from growing up around a bunch of Italians.  

Save room for one of the best versions of spumoni ice cream I've ever had.  That's a tall order, as previously mentioned, I grew up around a bunch of Italians.  It's a bit spendy (about $5), but it hit the spot.  It was split between three people, and we should have ordered two since we put the hurt on the slice quickly.

A few specialties for them: on the buffet: the sesame chicken, fish, walnut chicken (killer good), egg foo young, chicken skewers, egg rolls (good ones), chicken wings/drumsticks with a 5-spice flavor and their hot and sour soup. That hot & sour soup is the best I've had in any Chinese restaurant, a better flavor.

They are a pet friendly place allowing dogs on the patio (leashed), which we find endearing. There is also a bakery right next door - not sure if they are affiliated/partners - or separate - but we enjoy eating our breakfast and then grabbing some baked goods to take home.

This is a perfect example of price balance, speedy / accurate / polite service, hard working cooks, cleaner silverware than Sam Witches and Such, and good food.

The special for under $3 M-F is 2 eggs with your choice of hashbrowns and toast or a list of other sides.  I've tried this with grits, hashbrowns, pancakes, biscuits and gravy, white toast, and bacon - all are absolutely perfectly cooked and served to you in less than 5 minutes.

These are the fastest cooks I've seen.

The waitresses are fast and polite, not overbearing.  This brings me to a delicate situation:

I ALWAYS TIP THEM MORE THAN 40% AND I RECOMMEND YOU DO TO.

Allow me to explain:  I happily tip just over 20% at Sullivans and Flemmings, even with a bottle of Symmetry by Rodney Strong, when the service is good.  I tip over 20% when the service is good at any restaurant.  If I tip 20% here, the waitress get 60 cents = no bueno.  She runs around for a heck of a lot more than that.  (In fact, I donate 60 cents every day to a child in another country that I don't even know).  

So, I usually tip between 50 - 100% of the check here, and I implore you - if they give you good service, consider it please.

Then the food. I had a 14-oz ribeye with avocado, diablo steak sauce, and chili butter. I love high quality steaks, and this was honestly one of the top 3 steaks I've had in my life. Also had some of the charred corn (think helotes). Again, that alone was worth going.

Good time to go is anywhere between about September and December. That is if you intend to spend any time outdoors. The pool alone deserves its own review. Lovely, lovely views and two jacuzzis along with a poolside bar makes me -- and others -- very happy. And you can rent out a cabana and get the special treatment. I like that you are actually able to close each of the drapes in the cabanas and have nearly full privacy. 

So, this casino is still relatively new. It opened November 11, 2011. What that means is that you don't walk into the place and find that your entire body is cutting the cigarette smoke and smoke residue. 

You know what I'm saying. 

Have you ever been in one of those old timey casinos? Maybe in Vegas? You walk in and the cigarette smoke is so thick you can literally feel it on your skin, sitting on your eyelashes and glazing your eyeballs?

Just come along with a date or someone you are so entralled with and you will never notice.

Ordered same dinner for fair comparison: chicken teriyaki, nigiri, sashimi for $18.95. Chicken was definitely not stored at right temperature; tasted strong off note immediately. Nigiri: sake, maguro, ebi, and hamachi not as fresh, firm as Kazoku's. Sashimi: two pieces of sake, three of maguro; all smelled fishier than one would expect, and taste aligned with smell. Not good. Dinner came with miso soup, iceberg & shredded carrot salad, and potato salad. Overall, meh at best. Not as bad as I've had in places such as Bowling Green, KY (really should have known vetter), but not worth going out of your way for.

They do eat-in or take out, and I hear they do delivery but I'm not certain. 

I ordered the chef sauce noodle, and while it was decent it just didn't seem ~$9 good which is what you end up paying after tax. The dish was mostly noodles, lacking much of anything else. The sauce, meat, and green onions were practically condiment portions, but still managed to leave a large pool of oil/grease at the bottom of the container they were placed in. I put more sriracha on stir fry that already has sauce on it. The noodles were decent but nothing to write home about, and for all I know could've been bought from a store. 

The people running the counter were nice but for lunch time with no one in the restaurant when I arrived, service was pretty slow (I got mine to go). 

Overall, Kung Fu Noodle isn't bad, its just okay. With China Pasta House being only 10 minutes away with higher quality, quantity, homemade, and cheaper noodles + potstickers, I have hard time thinking I'd choose this place first. 

Worth a try, I'd take it over Americanized Chinese food any day, but the prices are a bit steep for what you get.",2015-05-01 00:48:49,Kung Fu Noodle,Tucson,AZ,4.0,217,"Restaurants, Dim Sum, Chinese, Cantonese, Noodles, Taiwanese, Szechuan",95,4.07,6

They have such a good selection of flowers (for bouquet arrangements).  Its about $1 a stem but they've got gerbera daises, sunflowers, hygrangeas, tulips, so pretty.

I was shocked at all the different things they have in there.  They have a section of cool recipe books, papyrus cards, neat little gadgets for your home.

Seafood section has Ahi steak for $22/lb.  Any place that has ahi steak  (wholefoods is the other) is a winner in my book since I wanna make my own spicy tuna hand rolls without mashed up ahi.  

OH be careful if you decide to buy exotic fruits.  The rambutans they were selling were $10/lb which is understandable since they may be difficult to find out here in Tucson....but the selection they had were ALL..i repeat ALL brown and DRIED up..the kind that my mother would forbid us to eat as children.  Normally rambutans are red on outside...brown is not a good sign.

They have a huuuuuge wine section and the clerk is so very helpful.  I was looking for a lambrusco and since they were out of that she helped me find a different italian sweet red wine (the adessa)  that was deeeelish.

The prices of goods here are about 50 cents to a dollar more than other places (for the same item, if u could find it elsewhere) but i still love it.

We have been avid Peter Piper-goers for years and have had several bday parties there. My son saw a commercial for Chuck E. Cheese a couple months ago and became obsessed with the idea of having his party there. After trying everything I could think of to talk him out of it, I gave in. 

I scheduled the party online, which was a cinch. We also got an extra 20 tokens for scheduling online and an extra 100 for having the party on a Sunday. 

Our host was Xavier and he was GREAT! Always available, checking in on us and totally on top of everything. They make a big show for the kids celebrating their birthdays: an awesome blow-up crown, air guitar with Chuck E., ticket blaster machine. My boy definitely felt the love. 

Now, it's not cheap and the food is what you'd expect. We paid about $250 for a party of 15 kids and 10 adults. And we brought our own cake and party favors. But, in my experience, that's equivalent to how much you'll pay for most other kids' party places. Plus, their games take a lot less tokens than PPP and they have the huge tube that runs across the play room and that's FREE!  And the kids just love that thing! I found that the kids played so much longer without coming back to ask for more tokens than they do at PPP. 

Finally, I'd be remiss if I didn't mention the awesome security. It's so comforting knowing there's no way a kiddo is getting out the door wihout his or her parent.

They really do a great job at our Chuck E. Cheese and we will definitely be back!!",2013-10-07 20:03:51,Chuck E. Cheese,Tucson,AZ,3.0,57,"Pizza, Arcades, American (Traditional), Arts & Entertainment, Restaurants, Indoor Playcentre, Active Life",22,4.48,2

I'll admit I was a little apprehensive going in the first time, but it was really good every time we went back and we make sure to stop in whenever we're in Tucson.

Tonight, we were craving Indian food and wanted to get out of the Phoenix area for a while. This was the obvious choice. My wife had her usual chicken tikka masala and mango lasse. I had the shrimp masala. We also shared the keema samosas appetizer, made better by the tamarind sauce, some kashmiri rice with some naan. The masala wasn't as spicy as I was expecting when I ordered it at a medium spice, but I'd rather have it be not hot enough than too hot. The masala mixed with the kashmiri rice piled on the naan is like an explosion of flavor that I can't get enough of. 

The atmosphere isn't too Americanized, nor is it cheesy over-the-top Indian - it's just right. The music that they pipe in isn't too loud, and it's really enjoyable. The service is always quick and friendly. The restaurant itself is smaller, but instead of feeling like a sardine in a tin can, it feels cozy. This is one of the few places my wife and I are willing to drive 2 hours just to have dinner at. 

If you've never had Indian food and haven't wanted to try it because you've heard it's really spicy, give this place a try (they'll make it as spicy as you like it, even if it's not spicy at all like my wife likes it).

Sigh.... My friend has already ordered a dozen wings.  We wait to see how these are before proceeding.  We like hot wings and there were a couple things wrong.  Number one, the wings were over cooked.  I mean really dry here.  I like dark meat on chicken/turkey and these wings could not be saved.  The hot sauce was what would compare to a mild sauce at some other non-wing places.  And the truly hot habanero sauce was vinegar based in a bad way.

I'm not really sure what I was specifically expecting, but what I got was basically (in my humble opinion)sub-par cafeteria food at a high-end bistro price.

When we walked inside, there were tons of staff, but nobody really greeted us and/or instructed us on the ordering process (which counter to go to, where to get drinks, etc).  I ordered half of the turkey/cranberry ""Signature"" sandwich (more $$) and half of a Caesar salad while my husband chose half of a regular turkey sandwich and half of a chicken Caesar salad.  We also got two fountain drinks.  $22.  I didn't blink twice because they advertised ""molasses bread"" and I'm a sucker for anything turkey-cranberry related.

We found a booth (and the soda fountain, kind of hidden in the back) and when our food came, my face fell.  I could have made a better sandwich at home for less than half the price.  Nothing special about the bread, the meat was mechanically separated lunchmeat product and the cranberry was canned cranberry sauce that had so much water in it that it pooled onto the plate and ruined the bread.  Not impressed.  The tomatoes were flavorless and mealy (people, stop putting your 'maters in the fridge!) and the lettuce had definitely seen better days.

The salads were okay- the croutons were actually really good (and normally I hate croutons) but the chicken, again, was rubbery processed lunchmeat product.  Gross!

It almost makes me want to open a restaurant just to watch everyone flock to it and take their money, and shut down just as the fad dies.  And I don't mean years later, when I start cutting corners and offering smaller portions and jacking prices while the service swan-dives...no, I'm talking about the minute a line 30 people deep, waiting for OK food vanishes.

Don't get me wrong, this restaurant is just fine if you want mediocre brothy soup embellished with garlic or spice, decorated with half a hard boiled egg.  Is this really the trend?  It must be, because people line up to stand outside on Speedway next door to May's Chicken and Waffles.  I can't understand this - given the choice between waiting for 25 minutes for soup vs. no wait for chicken/waffles/burgers, I'm going next door from now on.

The staff is fantastic, the environment equally excellent, and the ability to experience all of this, in one of Tucson's true gems - is one you will not want to miss. It is also one of the rare restaurants in the new Cronut (croissant/donut) movement that has been sweeping the nation - that actually does it uniquely, and well (though they are called 'doissants' at Prep, due to the fact the Frenchman who invented the 'Cronut' has a copyright on that specific naming of this pastry revelation). It is essential to get on of these if you go, whose flavors rotate everyday - and offer 2-3 different varieties, each day.

I like this place so much that when I met U.S. men's soccer captain Clint Dempsey, I had only two things to say to him:

1) I enjoyed watching you in the world cup
2) You should go to Prep and Pastry while you are in town training.

They are knowledgable and always so warm and welcoming to our out of town guests. The drinks are very well made. The Bloody Mary is the best in town in my opinion. It's has great spices on the rim, has some bacon, cheese, and olives as a garnish and comes with a small glass of their coffee stout. That tastes great to offset the spice of the drink between sips or I like to pour it in and mix it. All the food I have tried I love. I personally go back and fourth between the brick confit hash or the sweet potato hash as my favorites.

I came back to this location because my phone was malfunctioning so I had to take it to the Sprint store, which is 2 doors down from this Paradise Bakery. I had to hang around for about 1.5 hours and it was right around lunchtime so I said why not. I grabbed my laptop and a textbook, ordered some food and got to work.

I was leisurely eating while working on my computer, when one of the employees who is supposed to clear tables and deliver food walks up and almost tries to take my plate. I explain that I'm grazing and that I'm not done yet. About 15 mins later I had dutifully cleaned my plate and he comes back and says snidely ""Are you done, NOW?"" I almost wanted to keep my plate even though there was nothing left because I was so un-amused by someone bugging me about finishing my meal.

That last bit wasn't my favorite moment, but the next part is why I'm really annoyed. They only allow you 30 minutes of Wifi (from 11:30-1:30). I use Paradise Bakery as a study place and I find that when I'm studying at a location for 4+ hours I order a lot and the longer I stay the larger my bill gets. It's a serious problem for me that I can't use internet for 2 hours during the day at this location. I get that they want seat turnover, but there's no chance I'll ever go here for lunch now.

Their staff is so cheerfully friendly. The chips are great, I enjoyed the salsas, one mild and one hot. And I enjoyed the freshly made guac for $2.00 well spent. 4 stars.

My wife had the fish tacos, probably made of Tilapia. We're not huge fans of Tilapia as it is a tad fishy tasting. The tacos weren't bad, just not great, because of the Tilapia. It was small flanks of fish on a small street taco tortilla. She had a grilled and two breaded ones to try. 3 stars.

I had the tacos (?) can't remember the name, but the shells were crispy pan fried. It comes with three so I tried all options: a shredded beef, a hamburger, and a chicken. All were OK. Not great, OK. I actually didn't enjoy the shredded beef that much because since it was twice cooked, it was a bit fibrous and chewy. I just don't like shredded beef, I guess. Your mileage will vary. The hamburger one was OK and so was the chicken. It comes with lettuce, tomato, onion, cheese, and pico, but there is no way you can put it in the taco without breaking the shell into smithereens. So that was kind of a fail. I took a bite and forked some of the lettuce, tomato, onion, cheese, pico into my mouth. I also tried putting it on top of the taco shell sideways and eating it, but that wasn't successful, either. 3 stars.

We were in town for a few days and stopped into Charro Steak to check it out.  We sat at the bar.  I ordered an ""El Maestro"" off their cocktail menu.  The bartender said they ran out of peppers (jalapenos?) and to choose something else.  I did.  The other drink was okay but I really wanted that spicy marg.  My wife liked her drink (with the upside-down Pacifico).

On their lunch menu, they have ""Mixtas!"" - which seemed exactly what we wanted:  tapas-style plates we could share.  I ordered three (for $7) and added steak.  The bartender wanted to charge a split-plate fee.  I have always been confused by this concept.  If a couple are sharing food and want to eat off the same plate, that should be okay.

So I ordered more mixtas so she put the order in on two plates.  All together we had the Chilaquilas, Esquites con Crema, Chile Verde Mac & Cheese and Spinach & Nopalitos en Crema.

The steak was good....but the rest of the food sounded way better on paper than it tasted.

So far my first experience here was ""meh"" but I would definitely like to come back and have a real dinner based on the other reviews and photos I have seen.

All tapas are $2 off, so we had the bacon wrapped jalapenos ($6 for 3 during happy hour) and the chorizo-queso with chips ($7 during happy hour), the later being pretty tasty. We were later seated for the dinner (via opentable reservation). Given my experience with lunch, I opted for the chili con carne again, yet this time as an entree (see picture). I used to be a vegetarian, so this was a pretty gutsy order for me, but I am glad I did as the meat was very flavorful. All entrees are served with either soup or salad (both very small) and rice or beans. The tepary beans were excellent. My entree was also served with fry bread and a side of calabacitas.

This review is called ""getting it so so so SO right.""

Today was my third visit to Prep and Pastry.....in one week.
I read the reviews, prepared to be disappointed by the hype, and was not. There is typically a wait on the weekends (I have heard anywhere form 40 to 90 minute waits) so we chose to go weekdays.

Our first visit was to a very busy restaurant; however, we were seated and sever quite promptly. We started out with a maple dossant. My husband lovedddd it and I really liked it. It was just a precursor of the good things to come. The coffee was ""expensive"" on the menu. When we tasted  and drank the coffee we knew why. 
1. it is exo and majorly delicious 
2. They keep the refills coming
3. They offer to go cups

I ordered the banana foster filled french toast and the hubby got the poutine.
Delicious does not even describe the meal. I am not normally one to order sweets but the description reeled me and I am very thankful for that. 

On our second visit we got a little unlucky. They ran out of the cinnamon dossants from the time we sat to ordered. Okay, take two. They ran out of the blueberry earl grey scones in time we made the second order and he got behind the counter. Take three we ordered the snicker doodle cookie because we could see a dozen. It was delicious. I switched my order this time and ordered the pork belly beni and my husband got the am relleno. One of the things my husband remarked about was the size of the pepper (quite small). Turns out this was not a normal size as (without mention or prompt from us) a side of potatoes arrived at the table with someone (Manger? Owner?) telling my husband that the peppers were not up to their standards  and to please have some potatoes. My beni was actually kind of cool and while still good, I can only imagine how it would have been hot. I was overall happy with our meal and service when our server gave us as bonus cookie since we had a bit of bad luck on our visit. My husband raved about the initiative taken by the restaurant.

Today we returned and chose the french toast stuffed with berry compote and the tri tip sandwich. We also finally got to try the cinnamon sugar dossant. Amazing amazing amazing. I have loved most of the dishes and the two today did not disappoint. i was pretty jealous of the tri tip and will definitely be getting it the next time I am there (which will undoubtedly be soon).

Not quite 4 stars, but not 3.  Three and a half would've been a better fit.  The bump up to 4 stars was based on our love of their Hot Jalapeño Chicken Wings.  Now don't go there expecting bright orange wings glistening in sauce, accompanied by carrot and celery sticks, with ranch dressing on the side.  These are different and employ a Tucson favorite, the jalapeño.  The dish is basically little hunks of fried chicken topped with minced jalapeños and some other tiny pepper that looks like a chile pequin---awesome.  My husband usually gets the twiced cooked BBQ pork (not the regular pork, the BBQ one -- we got the wrong one once and it wasn't as good) and I look for something with broccoli in it.  I haven't found anything I like enough to order it twice.  But I like the appetizer enough to keep coming back to try again.

""Asian"" in the title because they serve Vietnamese, Thai, Korean, Japanese and Chinese food. We've only had the Thai and Chinese.
The iced tea tastes funky--so if you're an iced tea freak, this may ruin the whole thing for you.
""Chips & Salsa""--when you first arrive you get a bowl of fried wonton strips with plum sauce.  Avoid this.
They serve brown rice (in addition to white)  to bring down the glycemic index of your meal.

i had lost all hope for any decent ethnic food in tucson after trying almost a couple dozen, but praise the lord, thanks to  sher-e-punjab, all faith is restored. 

my bf and i had a great dinner last night. so many flavors wrapped up in each dish, even the rice had clove in it!!! the chicken tikka masala was fantastic, creaming flavorful goodness, unlike the tomato paste over at Saffron. the chicken in the korma pretty much fell apart - so amazing. and my favorite dish that i always order at an Indian restaurant, the navraton koorma; it was bursting with flavor and tons of amazing veggies and paneer!!!

we ordered everything 'spicy' and it was absolutely perfect. they aren't scared to put heat in the food, which most places in tucson seem to go the opposite route to appease all of the old retirees i assume.

Cheese on Speedway evoked indelible childhood memories:  eating my very first piece of pepperoni pizza, sugar-fueled birthday parties with friends, and lots of Ms. Pacman.  Those same awkwardly creepy, soda-drenched, matted fur animatronic characters still performed for the birthday partiers.  Other than transitioning from '60s songs to '90s music, not much had changed in the last thirty years.  I guess it was time for an update, right across the street.

The good stuff:

The ""sticky"" factor is gone, since the tables, carpet and paint on the walls are brand new.   The well-lit dining area is rectangular with no tube running along the top, which makes it a lot easier to keep track of the kids.  Some new attractions have been added, including an elevated, life-size rocking-horse. Flat screen TVs have replaced Chuck E and the gang.

The ""meh"" stuff:

The only tables that seat more than four people are in the reserved area.  Unlike before, our group of 6 had to sit at separate tables.  The games are right next to the tables, so we had to shout to be heard over the clamor.  Chaos reigned on this Saturday afternoon, leaving my nerves jangling.  By the time we left, I had a raging headache...vowing never to return.  (I will.)

I forgot to see if the new location has beer or not.  What the hell was I thinking?  That might have turned this into a four star review.

Without the nostalgia factor, Chuck E Cheese becomes pretty average for an adult.

As with many of my reviews, I've only been here once, but without a doubt I'll be back.  I'm so excited that, even though I'm stranded in the 'burbs (read: the east side) and bit of a drive away from Tucson's more ""stand-out"" spots that are closer to downtown and the University, this little gem is quite literally a 5 minute drive from my house.

We had an appetizer special, which was a pita with roasted red peppers, feta and some sort of seasoning.  It was the perfect appetizer size (as in, not such a giant smattering of food that you're unsure as to how you're supposed to eat your dinner), and it was just wonderful.  The feta wasn't harsh or dry--everything blended perfectly.

I had the chicken pilaf dinner, which was shawarma chicken with a huge portion of lentil pilaf topped with beautifully caramelized onions, as well as a salad, pita, garlic yogurt sauce and a little cup of hummus.  $10 and I took half of it home.  The chicken was well-seasoned and not dry and that pilaf might be the best thing that's ever happened to me.  Husband had a special which included a lamb kebab sandwich, fries and a drink for $9.50.  The lamb kebab sandwich was everything it should have been, but those ""fries"" were definitely the highlight (and not because the lamb was substandard by any means).  They're not french fries so much as they are fried potatoes but damn, baby, they're awesome--thinly sliced ""half-moon"" potatoes, seasoned and garlicky and a little lemony.  

Not much by the way of atmosphere, as it's in a strip mall and squashed between a dry-cleaner's and something else, and it's not all that well-labeled, but that doesn't seem to stop people from finding the place.  We ""ate in"" and there was a steady stream of take-out orders in the time we were there, and also a party of 4 was dining-in just as we were leaving.   Be warned--the dining area is SMALL.  There are some nice tables outside but we got here after the sun went down so we ate inside.  There are 4 2-top tables and 3 4-top tables (which look like they might be able to seat 5 or 6 if no one wiggles too much, but I don't know if they'll let you move chairs or not).  

No booze, but it's BYOBeer or Wine, and the party that was sitting as we were leaving brought a bottle of wine in with them, so I'm assuming it happens rather regularly (and there's a Safeway in the same plaza as the restaurant so it's also rather convenient).

I'll be honest: the only reason this isn't 5 stars is because I was a little less-than-impressed with the pita I was served with my dinner--it was sort of hard.

After noticing they had finally opened, I stopped into Mae's for lunch, and I'm glad I did. It's a cozy restaurant with an unusual choice of decor, but it's friendly and the menu is basically exactly what you'd expect from a Chinese restaurant -- complete with a $7-$8 lunch menu.

I ordered the Kung Pao Chicken lunch, which came with soup, egg roll, and fried rice. The hot and sour soup was mild but tasty (it could have used a little more bite, but my tastebuds are damaged and it might be hotter than I thought). The egg roll was huge, compared to the standard ""lunch-side egg roll"".

My entree was pretty large, with big chunks of chicken and no shortage of water chestnuts, peanuts, and peppers. Like the soup, I thought it could have been spicier. But I'm also a spicy food junkie. I was really pleased with the size of the lunch portion, and could easily have taken some home for later (but I overate instead).

The sole issue is that service was slightly slow, and I think that's just a new-restaurant issue.

The price is literally no different than Chipotle (actually cheaper depending on your choice), yet the food feels real, it feels like Tucson. $7 will get you any burrito with your choice of meat, beans, and rice along with accompanying garnishes.

Some of their drinks may be a little steep, but in my experience $7 for a good Michelada is not unheard of. The margaritas are excellent, and who doesn't like a good variety of beer with their tacos. Chips and salsa are also complimentary, self-serve as a matter of fact. 

Overall:
If you're looking for high quality, fast/casual Mexican food in the downtown area, look no further. In my humble opinion, it's worth parking for. Don't pass up Street, you won't be disappointed.",2015-04-02 20:19:34,Street- Taco and Beer Co.,Tucson,AZ,4.5,805,"Mexican, Bars, Restaurants, Nightlife",95,4.07,6

On a truly sad day, an Indian friend and I (both of whom are from Tucson) decided we had an Indian restaurant craving (which would thus not be satisfied by our Tucson Indian moms' cooking). We literally walked into Sher-E-Punjab, were given a table, walked up to the buffet, looked at each other with agreeing shakes of the head, and walked straight out. The buffet presentation we looked at was simply not up to snuff.

Potentially one of the most underwhelming experiences I've ever had. The server gave the distinct impression that she'd rather be anywhere else in the world, and that we were sort of an annoying imposition on her time. The menu was short; there was very little to choose from, hardly anything for vegetarians. The enchiladas couldn't be be made vegetarian because they were ""rolled in the morning."" The children's menu was unavailable (although the server recited it for the kids), as was the pizza menu, because they were being reprinted. The server couldn't recite the available pizza toppings, but claimed they had ""anything you'd put on a pizza."" When my father asked for his favorite toppings, they were not available. 

I ordered the salmon which was middling, nothing special. It was a small piece of fish drowned in an overly sweet sauce. The rice was edible, but sort of looked like it had been sitting around. Neither of these foods gave the impression of being very fresh, although the grilled vegetables were. At $20, it felt WAY overpriced. 

My mother ordered sweet pototo rellenos and didn't like them at all. It was just chiles, cubed sweet potatoes, and a bit of cheese, not really a relleno at all. 

My father got the pizza, and if it wasn't the worst pizza I've ever tasted, it was pretty close. I've had better pizza at the bowling alley. The crust was like a piece of soft bread. The ingredients did not scream ""high-quality."" This pizza made me yearn for the frozen generic pizza in the grocery freezer case.

The kids liked their meals. My stepson had chicken fingers, which were pretty run-of-the-mill, and onion rings, which were probably the best item we ate that night. The onions were sliced to a good size and the breading was crispy, although it had a strange, bitter aftertaste. I'm guessing this food was frozen.

My stepdaughter loved her macaroni, which isn't saying much. It looked like last week's leftovers and when my stepson tasted it, he said it tasted like it had been in the microwave. She was told the fruit side would be watermelon and strawberries, but there wasn't much in the way of strawberries, and the whole dish had the taste and appearance of something that had been sitting in the back of the fridge all week with discolored watermelon chunks and tiny random bits of other fruit swimming in the juice at the bottom.

Basically, nothing looked or tasted fresh. This place isn't doing much for the reputation of southwestern cuisine.

Also, our waitress disappeared after checking in on us once. (She was most likely not busy with other tables, as we were the only people in the section, and possibly the restaurant by that time.) Ten minutes after we finished eating, my mother had to get up and hunt her down to ask her for the check.

There are a couple couch seating areas and a lot of 4 tops.   

Started off with drinks.   I think the bar was slammed from a big party they had there so they took a wee bit to get them.  The rosemary honey cocktail and the pulpa margarita were sweet and tasty.

We wanted to try a good selection of authentic dishes so we went tapas style.  The dough god trio was wonderful especially the calabacitas.  Also had the Tostadas de Jaiba and that was the best thing I had.  Authentic crab in a killer cilantro aioli sauce.  If they made a bigger entree version of this it would be awesome.  Also tried the Potato nachos which were slices of potato fried covered with yummy cheese sauce.  Not the typical nachos and that was a pleasant surprise.

Had to try the fry bread dessert, I guess my expectation from street fairs etc was too much.  It was the only thing that was so so.  Otherwise I will for sure go back there and try other things on the menu.   Service was wonderful and attentive.

Soft and succulent corned beef accompanied by deep fried gnocci.  It also came mixed w/ Brussels Sprouts, and a perfectly cooked egg. The sweet potato puree perfectly balanced out the saltiness of the corned beef. I already dream about going back! Maybe tomorrow?! Haha. My other friend ordered the Pork Belly Beni. Beni, as in eggs Benedict. It came on a decadent cheese biscuit. I tasted it, and loved it as well. We will definitely be back soon!

We chatted while we waited for our lunch. When our food arrived, I was definitely impressed with it (which made up for the last not-so-stellar lunch order I placed)! 

I, again, tried the ""Pick 2"" combo, but this time, I order a half Chipotle Chicken Panini (chicken, applewood-smoked bacon, cheddar, tomatoes, & ancho chile spread) and a cup of French Onion Soup.

The French Onion soup was also delicious! They used small croutons, rather than one large slice of bread, which made the soup so much easier to eat! The flavor was rich, and the croutons were just crunchy enough after sitting in the soup for awhile! There wasn't a ton of cheese on the soup, but I wasn't missing it.

I was pleasantly surprised to find Kung Fu Noodles highly rated by Yelpers. With the ""Kung Fu"" name,  I was fairly skeptical, expecting a generic takeout Chinese restaurant.  Well,  don't let the name fool you! This place is legit! The often recommended beef noodle soup (""Kung fu beef noodle"") is solid.  Fairly spicy. Noodles are good and supposedly handmade, which I believe.  Also had the water boiled fish,  one of my go to spicy dishes,  and the rendition here is decent.  I've had better at dedicated szechuan restaurants,  but this one isn't bad.  Ditto for the dry cooked string beans.

Previous reviews described the poor service here,  though I didn't find that to be true. I found the staff to be attentive and prompt, though I was also here at 5pm on a Friday with most of the restaurant being empty. So your experience may vary.

The fish was pretty lackluster. It was plain grilled fish with absolutely no flavor at all. Beef and chicken were good though the beef was a little dry, the chicken the better of the two being tender and juicy. The shrimp in my opinion was the best.

I read other reviews and thought it would be a nice spot to stay in Tucson. They were also offering a spa package, which was a plus. I booked 2 nights in order to get the spa package. When I arrived I was told my room wasn't ready, so I went to the casino and played some slots (which were so tight as to be almost comedic). I finally got up to the 7th floor where my room was, and when I opened the door thought I was walking into a giant ashtray. The hallways reeked, but I thought maybe the rooms would be better. They are not. You cannot open a window either, not even a crack, to emit fresh air. The AC itself was merrily blowing a nonstop stream of what appeared to be straight cigarette smoke. I shut it off completely. When I called down to the front desk I was treated rudely, and I informed them there was NO way I could stay 2 nights in the giant ashtray room. I'm now waiting to see if they charge me for the spa that I am also not going to be able to go to.  The room was also nasty and dirty. For your pleasure I snapped a couple of pictures.

We frequent this place at least twice a month if not more and in the last few months things have not been to the standard they usually are. Staff less attentive, sloppy even, it took almost 15 minutes for toast in a relatively slow atmosphere compared to the usual bustle that is Prep. And although the lox plate is out of this world, 2 oz of salmon seems very little for a ""Lox"" driven plate and when we asked for more of the fish (happy to pay more as well) it took an additional 15 minutes because (as our waiter informed us) it depended on the ""chef's mood"".

But what I did NOT expect and GOT was food poisoning from AJ's.   

We have now twice picked up food from AJ's fast food area--Pizza, salad, soup, to take home on the weekends.   
And both times we have been sick for days afterwards: stomach aches, diarrhea, gas, etc. 

We ate at the outside patio one day a month or so ago and I went to the ladies room in the back.   I noticed that an AJ's employee in the stall next to me put her APRON on the restroom floor while she was going.   That alarmed me, but I thought 'oh well'.  

Twice since then my husband and I have been sickened after grabbing a slice of pizza from AJ's.

My friends and I had come in during the last week of June for the first time since the move/owner change. There was quite a bit of America decoration, but it didn't really phase us, as it was entirely seasonally appropriate. However, we knew there was something a little creepy going on when we came back at Christmas and it was all still there. The whole place screams ""'MURRRICA!!!'"" a little too loudly. Plus, they pepper the waiting area with Christian paraphernalia. I love that we have a free country where you can garishly display your religious preferences however you like,  but at the end of the day it can turn people off. 

That aside, it was a little overpriced for what you get, which is basic-ass breakfast food. Besides the Patriotism being shoved down your throat with every bite, the restaurant is housed in an old dance studio, so the atmosphere is a little off. The service is slow and forgettable.

The food here is pretty good, but it depends on what you get. They have very tasty seafood, pho, shrimp, salmon, green beans, and chicken. Now the hot and sour soup is okay, but usually comes without much in it. They have ""baked steak"" as an option but seriously, who eats baked steak? 

The service here is great, but I wish they would correct some of their practices. For example, they leave finished food trays right next to trays people are still taking food from. It doesn't come off as trying to be sanitary with the place. If you do the Hibachi grill and can't manage to sprint to the counter the moment its ready, expect the bell to be rung by the chef until you do pick it up. He either has a obsession ringing the bell or doesn't have a lot of patience. Either way, it gets a little annoying. Besides these two pet peeves, they do a good job greeting you and the servers do take care of you with a smile. Just watch out for the workers who stock the food; they act as if no one is around them.

I know there is much to stay about the name, ""U Like"". It has been the subject of many easy puns depending on if the person actually enjoyed the place or not. The name itself does its purpose of garnering attention, but can suffer the drawback if the person does not like the place. Of course, what do you do when you thought the place was okay. Do I just say it is the ""Kinda Like Buffet?""

Overall, I give this place 3/5 stars. It can quite noisy at this place, and there is a general tendency (with a lot of buffet places) that kids have have a lot of freedom running around the food areas. I wish some parents would do a better job with their kids, but I'm not a parent yet so maybe this is meant to be their free time. I am a sucker for cooked seafood and vegetables, and this place I can have as much as I want. I do plan on continue eating here because I am the buffet type of guy. As long as the food is not artificial and has enough healthy options, I will be at the buffet, regardless if the food isn't 5 star quality.",2013-10-07 19:55:07,U-Like Asian Buffet,Tucson,AZ,2.5,98,"Asian Fusion, Buffets, Restaurants",468,3.46,20

Being extra hungry, as one usually gets when on vacation, I ordered what I thought to be too much food, and basically ate it all 'cuz it was that good. You can get the chili French toast and you will be pleased with the salty sweetness combo, as other yelpers mention, you can try their take on the doughnut/croissant hybrid  the ""dossant,"" which is pretty good, however, someone in your party HAS to order the grilled cheese - preferably YOU! Ordering this grilled cheese sandwich has been one of the best (top ten) decisions I've ever made! This buttery, crispy, and gooey asiago bread one-ups your childhood favorite with pesto smeared in between its slices and topped off with a warm little squishy tomato. The creaminess of the white cheddar mixed in with the smokiness of the tomato make this vegetarian sandwich taste as rich as if you're eating bacon! Dunk it in the tangy tomato bisque, and take a big bite of Prep's garlicky herby roasted potatoes, and just sit there taking all of the goodness in.

The Breakfast Poutine: (4 / 5 Stars) The real highlight of today's brunch was my friend's Breakfast Poutine - I stole a few bites. The Poutine had a rich flavor and was very satisfying. 

The Duck Confit: (? / 5 Stars) Did not try but was told that the dish tasted great. 

Smoked Salmon Beni: (0 / 5 Stars) Although I was looking forward to my dish, the Smoked Salmon Beni was a huge disappointment. Not only was the salmon in small supply, it tasted like over-cooked frozen salmon rather than smoked salmon as advertised (definitely not a deal with the $12.00 price tag that comes along with it). Even though the eggs, potatoes, and other fixings of the dish tasted great, the core aspect of the dish was severely lacking - especially compared to the other items ordered at the restaurant. I was able to use hot sauce to mask the flavor of the fish.

Location: (Not a factor in the rating)

Prep & Pastry is a very nice and aesthetic looking restaurant. There are a lot of places to park even if the lot is full and we only waited about 30 min on a Holiday Sunday at noon.

The servers were very nice and accommodating at the restaurant. Additionally, they were thorough on ensuring that the kitchen staff was notified of my allergy to nuts.

We ordered 2 large pizzas, buffalo chicken breadsticks and 5 sodas... $78 WITH COUPONS! Holy crud! We could've got a feast at Peter Piper Pizza! Oh and the pizza.....it's awful! Frozen pizza blows this place out of the water! I'm waiting for my dad to regurgitate his salad from the salad bar. It's definitely been sitting out all day, all the toppings are mixed together and everything is shriveled up and dried out. 

This location is building a new location directly across the street. I really hope that it will come with a new manager and new cleaning crew! What a terrible experience for my daughter on her birthday!

The concept is clever burger patties in a burrito, taco salad, sandwich, etc.  Let me start by saying the amount of love and attention that they put into the hatch green chile sauce and their cajun sauce is noticeable and makes these sauces stellar. 
     Now the problem is that they don't pay as much love and attention to the other parts of the whole. I ordered a taco salad which comes with the green chile sauce, diced hamburger patty (beef or turkey), chopped tomato, chopped onion, all on top of a bed of lettuce and surrounded with tortilla chips. I had two problems with this dish: 
1. The hamburger was diced and not ground.
2. The hamburger was a frozen patty.
        I really feel like this food truck has potential to be outstanding if only they put the same amount of love into all items of each dish as they do their sauces. I would really like to see them make fresh or fresh frozen hamburger patties in the future maybe add some diced onion and hatch green chile's to the hamburger patty.",2014-07-17 03:28:16,Burgerrito,Tucson,AZ,3.5,34,"Food, Restaurants, Mexican, Food Trucks",17,3.72,0

Hubby and I LOVE appetizers, so a night like this was created for us.

I really only need one word to review my experience: YUM!  We were joined by another friend and, between the 3 of us, sampled pretty much the entire menu (except the soups; bread & oil; blackened salmon salad; and the mussels).  

I don't even know where to start because EVERYTHING was so delicious. The hot dishes were brought directly from the broiler, so they were warm and toasty.  The cold dishes were just that - cold.  Nothing was even remotely the wrong temperature.  Everything was so full of flavor.  But none of the flavors were overwhelming or excessive - each flavor was in just the right proportion to make a well rounded dish.  I have never tried pate before but if all pate is this good, I have a new favorite food.

My only complaint would be the portion size of some of the dishes.  The Mushroom, Basil & Brie Bruschetta consisted of only 2 slices of baguette w/ the toppings and we did run out of crostini for the Spinach-Artichoke dip (which they quickly rectified by bringing us more).  It did help, though, that many of the dishes were served with a side of greens - which were topped with a light vinaigrette and just as delicious as the main part of each dish.",2011-01-12 04:39:14,Ghini's French Caffe,Tucson,AZ,3.5,427,"Restaurants, Food, Breakfast & Brunch, Sandwiches, French, Bakeries, Salad",9,4.11,1

The most notable thing about our 12:45 Sunday brunch was the cooking time, about 20 minutes. This seemed to be a factor of one cook doing all cooking with occasional waffle help from a server.

She promptly told me that the patio was closed due to a large party renting it out. Not 5 minutes later they seated a table of 3 at one of the 5 empty tables out there.

 my husband and I are big sushi eaters, so we're always looking for awesome places in town. I saw all the wonderful reviews for this place - so we decided to go. 

Quaint little place- very clean. Got our drink orders and brought us some edamame. It was kinda slimy....

I had read the reviews about the self serve miso station, so I asked if I could get some. She said no, she would get it for me. I also saw her shew another patron away as he was attempting to serve himself.  So I'm not sure if that is still their policy.  

We ordered the 9 piece sashimi plate and a few rolls. Sashimi came out first. Salmon slimy, but tasted good, the tuna tasted a bit like a fish tank smells, and the 3rd fish.... (albacore?) Had no flavor. 

The rolls we got, however, were quite good. Solid flavor, and well put together rolls. We had the Fireball, Happy Roll, spicy tuna roll, and the Eskimo roll. The only complaint I had about them was they were pretty small for the price, and had the smallest amount of fish the could use. Best roll we got was the fireball.

Who knows... maybe we caught them on a bad night, but I don't think we'll be making a point to go again.",2015-05-17 02:29:56,Sushi Nara,Tucson,AZ,4.5,159,"Sushi Bars, Japanese, Restaurants",13,4.15,1

I had the Cobb salad, which was perfectly acceptable, and better than a much more expensive one I'd had the day before. In particular, the quality and quantity of the meat was impressive. 

This review is mostly to recognize the efforts of our server and (especially) one of the managers - bearded chap, John?? - who took great care of my wife, who has numerous food sensitivities. They answered her questions patiently, and at one point, John (as we shall call him) came out to discuss in detail the ingredients of the salad dressing. Collaboratively, a good solution was found - and my wife enjoyed her meal very much.

I ordered the eggs benedict and a kid breakfast for my daughter (scrambled eggs, potatoes, toast. ) When my dish came, I was horrified.  Hollandaise sauce should be fluffy and uniform.  This was a runny, separated soup that engulfed not only both halves of the sandwich, but the entire plate, it was just a big plate drenched in melted butter.  The meat was flavorless and appeared to have been boiled.  The english muffin was dense and had an odd flavor.  I would have told the waitress, but she never did check on us.  Finally I went to the front and simply requested another plate, we were in a hurry and I wanted to get out of there, I did not have high hopes that ordering something else would make me any happier.  I took the extra plate, wiped off the eggs best i could and literally tried to wring out my muffins.  The coffee, rather expensive for plain brewed coffee ( 2.75 I think) was just average, and overpriced to my way of thinking.

I live less than a mile away, and for months I've watched the construction with anticipation. When I heard it was a Blake's, I researched them on the interwebs and got even more excited. I was *so* excited, in fact, that on opening day, I arrived before they opened and was the third person in drive-thru. (on a side note, the trash folks arrived right after me, and couldn't get to the dumpster, so we all had to move out of their way, let them do their job, then go back in place.)

For this ""getting to know you"" phase, I ordered a bacon breakfast burrito, a Southwest burrito with red sauce, and a Lotaburger with no add-ins. Despite being the third person in drive-thru, it took quite a bit to get my food, but I figured it was due to just opening. I took the food home and cut it in half so my teenager and I could try it all. The bacon burrito was...just okay. The hash browns were a big white mush and the green chiles were too hot for me. I had to pick them out. Teenager agreed, except the chiles were fine for him. I took one bite of the Southwest burrito and actually yelped. My mouth was instantly on fire! They should warn people about the red chile sauce because it was way WAY too hot. My lips and tongue were throbbing, and I couldn't eat any more of it. Teenager liked the burrito, except he said it was too small for the price. The Lotaburger (thankfully, I didn't put chiles on it!) was just okay. It was like a poor hybrid of a Whataburger and an In-N-Out burger, and neither of us were overly impressed.  So...overall, my impressions were ""just okay, but the chiles were too hot"" while teenager thought it was ""just okay, but too many onions used.""

A week later, we gave it another shot. We arrived late in the afternoon, and were smart enough to park in the adjoining church parking lot, right behind the bus stop. Interestingly, there weren't any people in line to order, but there were many people waiting for food.

This time, we ordered chicken strips, the grilled chicken sandwich, regular fries, seasoned fries and onion rings to go. It took FOREVER to get our food! For most of our wait, there were several other people waiting for their food, and one of the crew members kept telling us to move out of the way. (Here's a tip...if too many people are in the way..maybe get the food out faster?) The kitchen was full of people, so I don't know what the deal was with getting food out.

Anyway, our order FINALLY arrived and we took it home. Like before, we divided everything in half so we could sample it all.  Once again, the food was just okay. The chicken strips seemed small, and were nothing special. The bun on the grilled chicken sandwich was a sodden mess because of the mayo-like sauce they used. It fell apart quickly and both of us wound up just eating the grilled chicken and leaving the rest of the sandwich. The fries were  just okay...nothing special. The seasoned fries weren't very seasoned, and the onion rings were decent but too greasy.

So, to recap, in our two visits we tried:

a Lotaburger
a bacon breakfast burrito
a southwest breakfast burrito
a chicken sandwich
chicken strips
french fries
seasoned fries
onion rings

The overwhelming result: nothing outright sucked (except for that wet bun), but none of it was really good. It was just one big MEH. Add the intolerable wait, and this is one place we won't be revisiting anytime soon.

I'm so disappointed.

ps...my mom texted this morning, and said she was the second person in drive thru at 6:21am, and she didn't get her food until 6:39am.

When Blake's came to Tucson, I was really excited!!!

Don't believe the hype. The green chile cheeseburger at Blake's is a mediocre burger overall with the saving grace being the green chile. The green chile is delicious but not very hot, at least for my taste but that's not where I find fault with this burger. The actual burger is greasy and just a whatever burger. Mine was thrown together so sloppily that I had more onions and tomatoes off the bun than on it. I literally had to put my burger back together before I could eat it. And then the grease started dripping off my hands. Honestly, I would compare the ""burger"" part of my sandwich to any old fast food place but priced much higher. We also had seasoned fries which were good and onion rings which were not. The size of the order of onion rings for the price was NOT a bargain at all.

So I'm glad I finally tried Blake's but I really don't think I'll be back.

Even after being open for only a few weeks and with a line of customers out the door, Raijin Ramen has quick, speedy service. While I felt a little rushed eating my ramen, since they clearly wanted to turn over my table to get more customers inside, the service itself was still attentive and not overbearing.
Their vegetarian ramen was surprisingly different than the vegetarian miso broths I'm used to having at ramen shops, and was a nice change of pace. The bowl itself included some unusual and not-so-traditional ramen add-ons, like thinly sliced zucchini, but it still tasted good.
I would prefer for Raijin to have a miso vegetarian broth, since that is my preference, but I think it's nice that they have a vegetarian option at all, since many ramen places do not.
Seeing as how it's Tucson and ramen doesn't really exist here, Raijin's got a monopoly on the ramen market in town, and that's probably how they can get away with their prices.

Unlike a few other taco shops you can take a handful of chips from a heated machine, which is a nice touch. Choose your own salsa and refill your own drinks. You can also get beer here which is a nice touch when you're having a quick taco any day of the week.

As I am headed to and from, I pass the most peculiar storefront that always seems to have a parking situation on a daily basis.  I mean you can't even see the front entrance on most days, the car park is that packed!  It's a place called Wings Over Broadway and I keep hearing positive things about it.  Today is Saturday: my bud/colleague are out of ideas for lunch, so we figure what the hell.

We phoned in a take away order; I ordered a dozen wings, medium flavoured, he orders a dozen, half mild and half lemon pepper.  I also ordered a batch of bacon cheese fries.  Order is ready in fifteen minutes, I get to the store, surprisingly I land a parking space right in front of the main entrance, and the cashier tells me my order had just come out.  Oh shklit, fresh hot wings!

Back at the office break room, we tear the shklit out of that plastic bag, we are both very hungry.  My medium wings are astounding; sauce is not too runny and not too thick; the taste is somewhat less then what I would consider to be medium- more like half mild- half true medium; but it doesn't reek of vinegar and doesn't drip too much so overall I am pleased.  Added bonus; these wings are fried to crispy perfection.  I appreciate a good crisp, as I have had many wings which absorbed too much sauce and rendered into limp mushy nuggets with bones in them; not these wings.  The meat is moist and steamy, no sign of dry to be found.  

I trade with my bud, one of my mediums for one of his lemon pepper.  It was acceptable, a tad dull perhaps because I'm still under the influence of the medium spice.  Its not fair to dismiss a flavour if I can't taste it properly.  I can never understand why anyone would eat an atomic flavoured wing; all you're tasting is the pain from the capsaicin and not the actual morsel.  

Bacon cheese fries are out of this world; homemade seasoned fries smothered with melted cheese and bacon.  Made me sad that I had six more hours to work instead of kicking back at this chicken wing shack with the giant telly showing the UofA Wildcat game with those fries and a nice cold beer.  C'est la vie...

The verdict?  Why on earth did it take me so bloody long to succumb to crispy sauced poultry Nirvana.  I must spread the news about Wings Over Broadway to my friends and family; they have to experience the goodness I had today. Thank you for a wonderful experience.

If he converted his restaurant to Jordanian food, it could easily be one of the best in town.

Going off the last sentence above, I will say avoid the buffet. The soups and the hot food were cold, while the cold food wasn't cold enough. The Middle Eastern food he brought out saved the meal. They do have a regular American food menu so you are better off ordering from that.

This location of Famous Sam's is the Die Hard Raiders Booster Club Tucson Chapter's home base and because of that simple fact, I get a tug in my heart, a tear in my eye...awww hell, I get all verklempt. Raider Nation, baby!!!

So yeah, I'm going with 4 stars because the owners basically hand this place over to Raiders fans on game day and their staff works EXTRA hard trying to keep the sea of silver and black happy and for the most part they truly do keep all the patrons happy. 

As for the food - it's fair, probably above fair. The wings are average - the ""hot"" isn't really hot at all. Chicken strips are fantastic - meaty, moist and BIG!! Steak fingers are just okay. The Jalapeno Bottle Caps are pretty good if you like spicy. Most places seem to use very mild jalapenos for a lot of their dishes like nachos so I was expecting to be bored with the bottle caps. WRONG. They're spicy little battered and fried sliced jalapenos. Delicious! And I've always been a fan of Famous Sam's pastrami sandwiches. It's been years since I had one and they're still as tasty as I remember them. Mmm, mmm, good. 

I must say that Famous Sam's fails in the French fry department. Despite numerous attempts, every time we order fries or they are included as part of our meal, they come to the table limp and undercooked. Recently we ordered fries with nacho cheese sauce and the fries were literally uncooked in the middle. Had to send them back after explaining the raw potato product and our server brought us a new plate. Excited to finally get the fries and dip them, L & I each took a bite and the look of disappointment appeared on our faces. They were just as bad as the first helping. We explained to our server that the fries were inedible but we did not wish to send them back again. She checked on us a few more times throughout the game for beer and water and even mentioned the uneaten fries and how she knew they were unacceptable. But when our bill came, guess what was still on there? That's right - the fries. A quick talk with the manager fixed remedied the situation and all was right with the world again.

I love this place for Italian, because they are not the pricey Italian food you get in the foothills that barely fills your stomach, leaving you hungry for more.  They give you large portions that taste great too.

You get awesome garlic bread with your meal.  This is real garlic bread, and not bread sticks.  This is one of my favorite things about Caruso's.

I always get the antipasta for 2 or 3 people when dining with others, as this is a great Italian salad.  The dressing is amazing, and it comes with things like baby corns, olives, tomatoes, onion, artichokes, and peppers.  Its a great appetizer.

The spaghetti with meat sauce and meatballs is my go to dinner of choice.  The caruso sauce is great too, but I just prefer the meat sauce.  The lasagna is also amazing.  They have tons of choices, but I stick to the classics.

The pizza is another good choice if you are with a larger group.

The interior of the restaurant is dimly lit, and has murals and paintings throughout.  The back patio is great if it is not too hot or cold, and is a nice addition.

The service may be lacking at times, but they more than make up for it with the food they serve.  The management should take more care in the service though, because it does upset me at times.  But I can't stop going there as the food is way better than Olive Garden.

It was only a 20 minute wait which is great for this Restuarant. We ordered and then were notified about 15 minutes later that they were out of the rotisserie chicken-3 people of the six ordered this. HOW THE HECK DOES THE CLAIM JUMPER KNOWN FOR THEIR ROTISSERIE CHICKEN RUN OUT OF CHICKEN??? HORRIBLE! Then it took about 25 minutes to get one of our appetizers! KITCHEN SERVICE SUCKS! Two managers (one female & the other male) came to our table to check on how things were- THEY SHOULD NOT DO THIS AS THEIR POOR EXCUSES FOR THE LACK OF CHICKEN & CRAPPY KITCHEN SERVICE WAS RIDICULOUS! The girl manager who visited our table stated, ""we were not able to handle what was put on us today!"" GET OUT OF THIS INDUSTRY THEN!! Goodness I would hate to see what would happen if they were REALLY busy! Many many many empty tables! Not usual for a Claim Jumper as we have experienced in the past!! Then to make matters worse the male manager visited our table- when I brought up the fact that they ran out of chicken he stated, ""that was totally on me as we only had sold 2 chickens by lunch so we only made 4 more so we would not have leftovers?!?!?? What the hell? REALLY- so run out of food to spare a few bucks for a multi-million dollar chain restuarant. POOR DECISION! He also stated that it takes over 2 1/2 hours to cook one of the chicken.

Dinner here the other night, first time, though we've been to the other El Charro places dozens of times.  Nice ambiance, but very noisy - the place was pretty empty when we were there, I shudder to think of how loud it must be when crowded.

Our server was very attentive, getting drinks ordered, appetizer going, etc.  Nice job splitting our Caprese app on separate plates without out us even asking.  Speaking of which, this was oddly one of my favorite tastes of the evening - the poblano and sauce were a nice touch and added a lot of flavor.

My second favorite taste was our side dish, the roasted Brussels sprouts.  They were perfectly charred, and a good portion for two to share.

We had the ribeye surf & turf special which came with a couple of very big shrimp.  The steak was perfectly cooked and tender, but just a little bit gristly which grass-fed beef often can be.  Our companions had the tomahawk steak, which was absolutely huge (see photo), but after the gristle was removed probably had no more usable meat than our more modestly-priced ribeye.  The price you pay for the ""wow"" factor of the bone-in cut I guess.

We opted out of desert, just too full.  The tab came in at a reasonable price compared to some of the other steakhouses in town considering we had a full bottle of wine.

Overall a very pleasant experience, but they might need to trim their steaks a little better.  Maybe some of the other cuts would be cleaner.",2018-06-09 17:41:27,Charro Steak & Del Rey,Tucson,AZ,4.0,589,"Diners, Restaurants, Steakhouses, Mexican",539,4.04,20

We were psyched! We entered and were seated immediately. The restaurant wasn't super busy and we were greeted by our server pretty quickly. We ordered a bottle of wine and received it right away and were poured a pretty healthy glass. He also served us some garlic bread that was a little more than toasted, meaning you bit into it and it disintegrated into dust. Oh well. It's only bread, right? No biggie. Our waiter returned and we placed our order. Garlic and Oil. Two Italian staples, right? Nope, not here. We placed your typical italian restaurant order.I got the eggplant parm and my husband got the veal parm. My husband ordered a side of aglio ed olio- garlic and oil spaghetti. The waiter was a bit confused, so my husband explained, ""You know, garlic, oil and butter sauteed, spaghetti thrown in?"" The waiter acted like he knew what we were talking about and then retreated to the kitchen. A few moments later, he came scurrying back to our table and told us that there would be a $.75 charge for the garlic and butter. Say what? We were a bit perplexed, but we took it in stride. A few minutes later he arrives back again with our dinner that did not in anyway resemble eggplant or veal parm or garlic and oil spaghetti. The eggplant was cut into spears, like pickles, unbreaded, and was thrown into sauce with cheese broiled over the top. The veal was a bit stranger- more of a scallopini sliced very thin, unbreaded with same cheese and sauce broiled over the top. The spaghetti arrived with a literal pat of butter on the top, sprinkled with garlic salt. Yup, no kidding, garlic salt. It was so salty that it was  unedible. My husband expressed his displeasure to the waiter, who scurried away yet again, never to return... Until it was time for the bill, of course. Hysterically enough, they removed the $.75 charge for the unedible spaghetti, but there was no other explanation or apology made for the really substandard food or the resulting lack of customer service.

A lot of the food is not your standard Szechuan/American hybrid. While they do have a few of the standard dishes that we think of as Chinese like beef with broccoli and Mongolian chicken, many of their dishes are Cantonese style. If you are a fan of Egg Foo Yong, this is the place to get it.
Their lunch buffet is very affordable, at six dollars for Monday through Friday and seven dollars on weekends. This includes drinks. The thing I love about it is it has several very popular standard dishes that are always on the buffet, but also has a few unusual dishes so that your experience at the buffet is never the same.

I had heard that it was serving Kurdish food, and I was excited to try it as I have eaten very delicious Kurdish food (homemade meals) in Phoenix.  Kurdish food is actually more gourmet; the dishes can be very complicated, and the flavors are complex. I tried their Pillaw (a thin puff pastry type shell stuffed with cubes of beef, chicken, rice, and very delicious seasonings). When I told my friends (Kurdish) in Phoenix that I had tried Pillaw, they were very jealous, saying they had never made that particular dish. This was truly a gem of a restaurant (14  years ago). The most recent time I ate there, Pillaw, along with some of the other more ethnic Kurdish dishes, had been taken off the menu. Instead, it seemed to be more like a typical middle eastern type restaurant offering mainly gyros for the entree. Another disappointment was the change from authentic Kurdish music to heavy rock--a type of music played more for the enjoyment of the young servers, it seemed, than for customers seeking something unique or different. In essence, I wish them well, but it seems they have lost their way. If they were to go back to their roots, it could be a very delightful restaurant (again).",2017-10-25 04:45:44,Sunrise Cafe,Tucson,AZ,3.0,62,"Restaurants, Food, Middle Eastern, Mediterranean, Greek, Coffee & Tea",68,3.1,2

I got home could wait to try as they smell sooo in the car. Tried the the Golden heat was on point fresh crispy juicy meat the garlic parmesan were as well. Next tried the Habenero heat oh man were they gross they tasted of raw garlic and raw Habeneros the wings were hard as well and just tasted awful ! That's when I noticed the wings were not cooked fresh they had been re cooked or re fried  25 wings down the drained never tasted wings so nasty it just ruin my n everyone's appetite to eat those we next got the honey BBQ nothing honey about they were over loaded with pepper to the point they were pepper spicy and were even more hard then the other ones a the sauce was ok but when the wing is not edible it just ruin it. The fries also were not fresh as well it may have been due to the oil needing to be changed as often  they were fresh but tasted burnt n of old oil. The fact that half the wings were fresh and the other half was not tells me this place is cutting corners or they are getting lazy and not doing the basic of running a restaurant like keeping  the food  fresh and keeping  the place tidy. Just remember also the carrot sticks and celery were not fresh as they tasted like refrigerator like a not so fresh refrigerator and did not have a crisp to them . Nasty as well. I would not recommend this place to anyone that likes fresh food but if you enjoy twice cook wings hard with black n burnt  chicken meat then you are the rarity and this is for you! Stay away. Eat there if you must try it as the dine in experience seem better for me than the take out but that just speaks of the inconsistent service.,2015-03-11 01:30:10,Wings Over Broadway,Tucson,AZ,3.5,302,"Chicken Wings, Restaurants, Sandwiches, Burgers",7,1.57,0

A charming personality that makes you feel like she's happy you've chosen Caruso's for your dinner.

*Note to manager/owner : As a manager  myself for several years in the retail business, I want you to know she did everything the right way business-wise. When she arrived at my table with the glass of ice water she also asked if I would like a glass of wine to start things off, then throughout the meal stopped by several times to inquire if everything was OK and could she do anything else to make my visit even better, perhaps another glass of wine? 
 At the end of the meal she brought the dessert menu and was ready to make a suggestion if I had left any room after that fabulous meal of clam sauce and red marinara over angel hair pasta. All this in spite of it being a Friday night between 7 and 9 o'clock when the restaurant was busy busy busy. 

Is this the kind of service customers should expect at a restaurant? Of course. Is it the kind of service you get in most restaurants here in Tucson? No.

They have each person's order separated by check and in different bags so they are easy to find and you know what's in the bag without opening all the containers!

I ordered lamb korma with a veggie pakora and a plain naan.  We fought a little to get some rice (my co-eater had to pull out some language skills on the phone when ordering to get it for us complimentary).

It was pretty good lamb korma.  Very tender, great sauce that I just wanted to keep eating.  A little oily but that was the only downside.  The veggie pakora was good as well and still crispy despite the drive. I thought it was a bit heavy though with too much potato.  The naan was too dry or too thin for my taste.

We ordered zucchini as an appetizer and it was terrible. How lazy is the kitchen staff when they don't even bother to put bread coating on to stay on the zucchini?! For entree Hubbs ordered potato cheese soup and I ordered hickory burger without the bun with shoe string fries. I guess the soup was OK since he didn't complain. Hickory burger was very small but the flavor was fine. All the condiments were sad though. Wilted and brown lettuce, frozen, mushy tomatoes, off tasting pickle chips the bacon, cheese and BBQ sauce were the high point of the burger. The fries are described as salt and pepper shoe strings... Well they are about 50% correct. Hardly any salt or pepper but they were shoestring.

Honestly, I just can't think of a time where I suddenly had a huge urge for frogs legs, but over the years I have heard so much about Le Rendez-vous I figured it was about time to give it a try.

We ate there shortly after the new Executive Chef took over this spring.  My dinner date and I went all out.  We had the escargot and the mushrooms in puff pastry.  I am not an escargot fan but my dinner date really liked them.  However the mushroom appetizer I ordered was to die for.  I think I would have poked him with my fork if he wanted to try a bite!  I am tempted to go back once a week just for that.  

After hors d'Oeuvres I was already filling up but went for the scallops which were melt in your mouth delicious.  My date had the Veal with caramelized apples.  He was very pleased and said it was a much better version of his favorite pedestrian pork chops and applesauce.  

For dessert, both now bursting at the seams, we shared the Crapes Suzette prepared tableside.  They were not on the menu but someone had recommended them and the staff was happy to make them for us.

Next time I go back I want to try the Happy Hour in the bistro which features small plates so that I can sample more before getting completely stuffed!

The meatloaf sliders.

Mon Dieu!!!!

I finally got to go to Friday Night Bistro, which was busy but not so packed that we had to wait. Gas heaters on the patio were very handy as I didn't want to take my 6-year-old dinner date inside with the nice tablecloths. I very much enjoyed my house greens with delicious fresh tomato slices and the amazing mussels in a delectable broth, but the show stealer was the meatloaf. Nestled in each of three beautiful, gleaming, fluffy, perfectly crusty brioches, tucked in with fresh spinach, were three of the most delicious slices of meatloaf I have ever tasted. I want this recipe; I don't know what she put in there but you should go and try it. The meatloaf is a blend of meats and spices, probably pan-finished to crisp them to bliss. I think sautéed onions may have been involved too. My date didn't want to try them at first, but once he had a bite, he inhaled the rest.

I especially enjoy the Tikka Masala dishes, but the Vindaloo and Rogan Josh are also delightful!

Along with your curry, you can enjoy rice and/or naan bread. The naan bread is solid, but the rice is incredible! It's super soft and really compliments the curry entrées!
Now, if you find the curry a tad spicy for your tastes, you can cool down with one of the most amazing drinks found in Tucson. Ladies and gentlemen, I am speaking of the legendary Mango Lassi. Now you can get one of these at any Indian restaurant, but there is no Mango Lassi out there like this one. It's fresh, sweet, and creamy and will quench any fire in your mouth from the curry.

Yes, the place is a bit of a dive, but divey is in, right?  And the location is about as central as it gets, at Broadway and Rosemont.  So the place feels a little warm inside with lots of fans going to try to cool it down.  There are a lot of TVs in there so you can catch up on sports.  I like this because they aren't trying to be something they're not - they don't have flowers on the table or rolled up silverware like Sam-Witches and Such.  WOB is just trying to give you a place to sit, watch TV and eat the best wings in town.

The lemon pepper are perfectly seasoned - not a cheap lemon pepper that can resonate an almost chemical taste.  These are top notch.  The medium has just the perfect amount of heat and the sauce is divine (I'm a big sauce guy).  The barbecue sauce is also perfect - not too sweet, not too hot, and immensely flavorful.  The teriyaki is wonderful too.

All of the wings have an amazing seasoning on the skin that just sets it off.  And the price is incredibly fair at 8.99 per dozen.  A nice touch is that they automatically serve it with carrots, celery and ranch dressing - some places make you add these on at a small cost.

Coming from a big city, I was skeptical of the Chinese food in the area so asked one of my local friends who had also spent some time in China, and he recommended Kung Fu Noodle. ""Silly name, great food"", he said. Since my dad was in town, I took him here.

Kung Fu Noodle offers ~10 dishes on a hand-written menu all price around $8, and I imagine they do them all really well. They offer noodle soups, dry noodles, and an assortment of dumplings and bao (Chinese buns often filled with stuff). I shared the chef's special sauce noodles and bao with my dad. The noodles were in a brown sauce, tossed with ground meat, scallions, and chili sauce. They were perfectly cooked and had that unique flavor of home-made noodles. The bao were crispy on the outside and had juicy pork on the inside. Plus, one order came with 6 huge bao for only $8. These dishes really transported me back to the time I was in Beijing. My dad, who grew up in China, was equally impressed.

The table next to us got soup noodles and the servings were HUGE. I will definitely come back in winter time when I need something hot.

Service was great. We waited a bit for the bao since they make them in-house and ready to order, but the waitress kept coming to update us and ask if we needed anything. Place was very clean and nicely decorated.

I have been to this casino several times, most recent being last night. A few friends and I have gone there to play bingo for their Thursday night Club Sol appreciation night. Thursday nights you get 20% off bingo with your Club Sol Card. To get a Club Sol card you just go to card services, show them your id, and you get a free card. Each time you go to the casino, you can enter into contests by just sliding your card at the kiosks, and you get rewards points and discounts. When I signed up, I also got $10.00 in free play. yay!

Bingo is fun, there are always a lot of people, be sure to sit in the non-smoking section if you don't care to get lung cancer. This plays fills up, so get there early. There are complimentary soft drinks, and also a snack bar with some baseball-like concessions.

I have gotten burned out with my normal venues and in a frantic mental search for where I hadn't been that was relatively close and might be ok, I remembered Amelia Grey's - I keep passing by at times when it's closed or for some reason can't go, and then I forget about it when I'm going...in any case, I'd been meaning to go, and hadn't.  The Native Cafe used to be a favorite and that location has since had trouble keeping an anchor. 

When I arrived on this weekday morning, it was no longer AG's, but Prep & Pastry.  Therefore, part of the imagery which had drawn me - ie, bakery case and cafe feel - was gone.  Instead, it was a nicely appointed restaurant in the ubiquitous chunks of wood and lofty ceiling all the places in Tucson now must do.  Maybe you can't even get a build-out permit in Tucson if you don't use that aesthetic, it's that pervasive.

The first thing I noticed was that the hostess stand is in the wrong place.  It needs to be further to the left so that a table or two can be put in front of the fire place without congesting the entry.  Now that space looks oddly empty and the flow through is wrong.  The second thing I noticed is that this place is heavy on the young men.  A woman may likely greet you and cook, but most of the servers I've seen are men.  That's interesting and definitely creates a vibe which I'm not sure if I like or don't.  

The first day, I was delighted to see that breakfast in some form can be had in the afternoons.  As we know, breakfast is best had at any time of day and should be always on offer, but rarely is.  I had the simple breakfast, which was indeed simple, but for a restaurant of a certain genre, not badly priced at $6.  Except, you know, they scrimp on the toast...artisan toast.  Eye roll.  My biggest complaints were that the eggs were heavy on the salt, the bread was too hard and the bacon too soft.  The coffee was very good, even if my server was too busy talking football and whatnot to refill it timely.  I did feel that I would be getting better service if I was cuter, which is not what you want.  All in all, though, my experience was good and I was sure to come back.

So, I did.  Sadly, it was a downhill experience.  This time I made sure to come in the hours of a full breakfast menu, only to find that it wasn't appreciably more varied.  I ordered the omelette after the waiter had fawned on its inclusion of steak, 5-yr cheddar, mushrooms, tomatoes.  Yum.  It arrived, again oversalted and without a trace of steak.  My toast also arrived hard and completely dry, with no butter or jam.  Sigh.  Coffee was still good.

But, here's what kinda altered my good feelings.  Hey, you know, they're new and I'm well willing to let some bugs get worked out while everyone is figuring out what works. Tweaking is inevitable. So, when I pointed out the lack of a major ingredient in my dish, I wasn't mad.  Just, you know, fix it.  However, the answer I got was that the waiter had made a mistake and read the ""beefsteak"" tomatoes as steak and tomatoes.  Ok, again, these amusing foibles take place.  And?

And nothing.  Though I would not have ordered the dish as it was and although the waiter was clearly in error, no one seemed to feel that warranted any attention.  Not a comped danish or coffee or jack.  So, what had been a good time by all was now a source of irritation at dumb customer service, which, if I am being frank about my bias, I think may relate to having so many boys in the house.  There's so often just a....lack of social finesse and empathic awareness when boys are in charge (Tony @ MakerHouse is a huge exception to this generality).

It all reminded me of the book, 5 Apology Languages.  I am, most decidedly, in the Accepting Responsibility and Restitution camps.  I am not interested in your flowery debasement, nor is mere acknowledgment enough.  I want to know how you're going to make it right.  Because, otherwise, an apology without making it right just tells me that you're paying lip service and really don't give a shit if I'm happy.  

So, yes, I'll probably go back for limited wants, but it is unlikely to be my go-to.

I tend to favor savory foods over sweet, so I knew I wanted something with eggs. I was thinking about an omelette but ultimately chose the green corn waffle because I was told the cafe was known for this dish. I thought the apple sausage had a nice flavor and it was definitely unique to have a savory waffle. Even though it was topped with a bit of salsa in its middle, the waffle overall was a bit dry and needed some kind of sauce. I tried putting syrup on it but the combination of flavors didn't taste right to me.

My friends and I wanted to find a sit-down breakfast joint that opened early enough for us to chow down on good food before my friend had to go to work. After browsing through Yelp, it seemed like Ghini's was the only candidate nearby. Although their door and website state that they opened at 6:30am, they seemed to be running late and didn't open until 6:45am. We had to seat ourselves and waited on a server for a few minutes. Eventually, our waiter came and, being slightly flustered, took our orders quickly. I was surprised to find that you can't order every single pastry from the bakery display on the other end of the cafe (apparently, they're separate businesses?) For example, you can only order plain croissants if you sit at a table, but you can choose from a variety of croissants if you walk yourself over to the pastry counter (strange). Anyway, I ordered the Egg Provençal with scrambled eggs and whole wheat toast. It really did seem like I had an overcooked order of 6 eggs - just a huge portion off rubbery sadness! (You might be better off ordering the eggs over easy).  The toast was overly buttered as well, which is fine if you like it that way. The only good thing I had was their cafe au lait, which was served in a huge mug. My friend had the breakfast sandwich, and she thought it was decent.

The menu is American, designed to be non-threatening and fun. The target demographic has breakfast at McDonald's, lunch at Applebee's, girls night out at the TGIFridays, and now, for a little splurge, must choose between Olive Garden, Red Lobster, or this place. 

Dinner was  $83 including tip -- that's for 3 entrees (1 BBQ ribs, 1 Black Tie pasta, Hill Country salad), 2 beers, and 2 iced teas. Hefty.

Prep & Pastry is kind of how I would want my home to be--warm, modern but not pretentious and totally about the pastries. I sat at the counter. So, I got to enjoy how they have a big window into the kitchen and you can see the pastry chef hard at work. Unfortunately, it's too noisy and too far to talk to her, not that I would want to disrupt her baking alchemy. I love the wooden floating shelves by the window where the have everything from plants to an egg beater.

I ordered the duck confit hash, which was solid. I think for my own preference, it could have used more salt but the duck part was very tender. The other ingredients seemed very fresh. One of the owners, Nate, started chatting with me. He was super-friendly and I think because I was by myself and watched the pastry chef bring out a tray of fresh cronut-knockoffs, he offered me one gratis. So I had the maple-glazed with crumbled, real bacon which was very yummy. I tried to ration it off but I finished the other half that same day despite swearing I'd at least wait til the next morning. The pastry chef is also a really friendly gal. She said she was looking for ideas for other cronut flavors and I just randomly made suggestions.

Got there at 9:00, just before the rush and were seated on the patio right away by the friendly hostesses (hostii?). Promptly greeted with water and menus.

We were unimpressed with each menu item; both were bland and it seemed everything was undercooked from the potatoes in the country hash to the brioche in the monte cristo.

We were there for dinner a week ago, 5 of us, we got seated pretty quickly then we were just sat and waited. The server was really busy, I'm assuming they were understaffed that night. She was friendly when she got to us but honestly it was a little annoying as we were hungry and didn't want to be there too late.
 
It was a pretty good wait  to get our food, my sons plate came out even a few minutes after the rest of us had ours. We could have still been been fine here as we were not looking for things to pick on, hey i know we don't live in a perfect world but  once we started eating nobody's food was hot. I'm pretty sure it had been sitting for a while waiting for the server to grab it.

Btw, the Mariachis were pretty good at first. The music was not overbearing, they were not too close and they did sound good! The girl with the fiddle was a real treat!
Then they got closer and louder and you know the deal, no more talking as you cant hear unless you shout, oh well.

Sorry i forgot to specify this, it was the Oracle rd. location.

Update: I was back in this location a few months ago as it is convenient for me and as I mentioned in my previous review the La Parilla locations were always at the top of my list for a tasty dinner . The staff was friendly, we got seated and waited on quickly, the food however was disappointing. I really hate to slam the place again but I really think the owners should spend time trying to figure out whats going on here.

My last visit I had ""The chef omelet with a side of country hash"" - which changes daily.
The mint leaves was a great touch to my delicious omelet.  

My favorite dish would be the ""Biscuits and Gravy"". Cheddar biscuit, sausage, smothered with duck fat gravy and two over easy egg on top. Need I say more?

Of course, you can't come to P&P and not have one of their famous Bloody Mary's! The Bloody Mary is loaded with ingredients: tomato juice, Worcestershire sauce, Tabasco sauce, fresh lemon or lime juice, horseradish, black pepper, and celery salt -- each contributing to ""a blend of hundreds of flavor compounds that act on the taste senses"". Well P&P sure knows how to hit all taste senses with their version of ""The Bloody Mary""

The wait staff here is on point, always so friendly and always make sure our glasses are never empty.

We ordered the antipasto which was nicely varied and plenty for all of us. They also served a soft   focaccia bread and delicious herbed dipping oil as a starter.

We didn't have soup or salad so I can't comment on that. I was a little disappointed with my entree which was the Pork Ricotta. It tasted like the meat had hit a hot cast iron pan and it left some of the iron flavor on the meat. Not my favorite flavor. But otherwise it was okay.

The Seafood Soup looked good and the Roasted Beet Salad was well received.

I was very favorably impressed by our waiter. It's nice to see a truly professional server in action. The staff could not have been more accommodating. 

When we made the reservation they agreed to let us bring a small cake which after dinner,  they brought to our table, with our supplied candles lit. They also cut and served it at no extra charge. This is something that, of course, increased the tip, as it should.

My sisters declared that the wine list was good and we had three bottles of a tasty Chardonnay.

The coffee was flavorful and strong but not overpowering.

Our waitress Penelope came to our table pretty promptly too, to take our drink orders.  She was very patient with me while I was trying to decide what I wanted to order.

While waiting for our soups, Penelope brought their cheese bread, which was quite yummy!  I ordered the cocoMojito (I think that's the name) which was quite yummy too.  A bit too much ice for the price we paid but still delicious.

Hubby and I shared the creamy chicken tortilla soup and the New England clam chowder.  Both were very good.  

Penelope gave us another serving of bread because we devoured the first (I was hungry, lol) and our water was always refilled.  She even apologized for accidentally putting too much ice in hubby's glass.  That was sweet, though he didn't mind at all.  

Our entrees arrived and the potions were a good amount.  Since I did not know what I wanted, I ordered the Widow Maker, because that was one of the sandwiches Hubby was debating.  That thing was HUGE!!!  I took out the two onion rings and gave them to my hubby.  The negative I will say about the burger is that we ordered it to be cooked well done.  Part of it still had pink, which was the part we did not eat.  

Hubby ordered the tri tip and that was quite yummy!  Penelope knew we were sharing our entrees, so she brought an extra bowl of the au jous.  She didn't have to do it but she did.  And we greatly appreciated that.

Hubby told her it was my birthday and she brought out a red velvet cupcake with a candle on it for me!  She even brought two forks for me to share....so sweet!  

The manager on duty checked on us and chatted for a bit.

The Rice was cooked perfectly and the Naan was also great, with a nice charred texture from the Tandoori oven. The chicken Vindaloo was prepared nicely with fresh cilantro and a flavorful sauce.

Although we had the address, it took us a while because we were looking for a big sign that read ""The Dish"".

The setting is modern, intimate and may even feel a bit pretentious. Patron dress ranged from casual to dressy, but all pretty tidy. The ambience is best for couples, the tables are small, much like round bar tables where one might stand, although there are high stools available. The largest table I spotted could accommodate a party of four, rubbing elbows. Since we had kids in tow after a long day out, we decided that it would be more comfortable for us to buy take-out.

The food was very tasty, but the portions were not huge. We ordered a chicken dish, a pork dish, but our hands-down favorite were the steamed mussels, which not only tasted heavenly, but were also a phenomenal value, compared to other menu items. What puzzled me was that our waiter was a bit tentative about our take-out order, not being sure if our mussels could be made for take-out since it would be ""brothy"". Made me wonder if no one else had ordered take-out before. (""Things that make you go ""hmm..."") Bottom line was that they did have good take-out containers and none of the savory broth was spilled. Just didn't expect ""take-out"" that to be an issue at an establishment like this.

The prices were on the high side, but may be rationalized by the quality of the food. The ""jumbo shrimp with serrano ham"" was tasty but the size of the portion (and the shrimp) was a bit disappointing. Other than that, everything qualifies for ""thumbs up"". The complimentary bread was also very good.

The wine and cheese section carried a wide variety of wines and spirits. Dining patrons may order wine from the restaurant or pick a bottle from the wine shop but pay corkage. The cheese deli was also very diverse. We bought some very special and delicious fig tapenade, which was a new recipe from one of their chefs.

Verdict: best for a romantic night on the town and if money were no object. Wasn't looking for oysters, but the mussels are a must-have.",2008-01-03 07:52:12,The Dish Bistro,Tucson,AZ,4.0,69,"Beer, Wine & Spirits, Arts & Entertainment, Wineries, Restaurants, American (New), Food",194,3.26,4

Barrio Cuisine does this rhetorically but it's hard to leave the restaurant without wishing they'd push native ingredients into more prominence on their menu.

There's nothing inherently wrong with this, but Barrio Cuisine's menu appears to be aiming for a demographic of people who like the idea of O'odham and Yaqui food without actually wanting to try scary new flavors. So there's a cholla bud pico de gallo that features scarcely a cholla bud and a nopales salad with almost no cactus in it. There's fry bread, which is safe for even the most timid Midwestern palette, but the only bean on the menu is in the tepary bean hummus. Squash is represented a little better, but it's not too prevalent other than in side dishes. There is a lot of meat (burgers, steaks, ribs, chicken) and a few Mexican restaurant staples (enchiladas, tacos), but the tweaks to those dishes don't make them stand out as unique.

If you are a food nerd and have spent time flipping through an O'odham cookbook like ""From I'itoi's Garden"" and wishing someone would start a restaurant that served those recipes, you'll have to keep waiting. Barrio Cuisine is not that place.

But if you accept Barrio Cuisine for what it is, it's okay. Most of the dishes were very well prepared--the folks in the kitchen can execute a recipe well and know how to present a dish. The calabacitas enchiladas were better than most restaurants and the Chilean crab and aioli tostadas were excellent, though it's hard to know how they relate to traditional O'odham or Yaqui food. Is it the word ""tostada""? The salad was unimpressive, but that was an issue of design rather than execution. The pico should advertise cholla buds when they're in season and leave them off the menu when they're not--the rehydrated ones are flavorless. The tepary bean hummus was rich and tasty, but nothing you couldn't do at home. Overall, the quality of the ingredients was quite high.

Barrio Cuisine positions itself as a casual, yet slightly higher end restaurant and the prices and atmosphere reflect other restaurants in that category. The interior is nice, the portions aren't gluttonous, and it's a bit too expensive. A meal there certainly won't disappoint but, as of this writing, it doesn't yet live up to its full potential.

The one we weren't crazy about was their version of Hawaiian, which added onions, peppers, and shrimp to the typical Canadian bacon and pineapple. It was way too much on a slice.

After a painful 20 mins of trying to navigate their ""on line ordering"" I just gave up.  The pics looked so great and there were some pretty good reviews here on trusty old Yelp, so I called in.  
It was a Saturday night and they were busy.  Even ordering over the phone was kind of a pain...but we got though it.  The food came in less time than they estimated, the delivery guy was very nice and seemed to have his act together.  But then we tried to eat the pizza, and that is where we made our mistake.  
The pizza was very thin and had nearly no crust!  Normally, this wouldn't upset me too much....but the whole idea behind this place's gimmick is that they offer so many flavored crusts!!!!  The pizza was slightly worse than the $1 Titinos ya buy at the super market, and roughly the same size.  And it was $16.  
There were wings too.  Not nearly as disappointing as the pizza but most definitely from frozen, pre-seasoned and just bad.  
The only reason I gave Howies two stars was because of the sandwich.  Thank goodness my far better half had a craving for an Italian sub or our meal would've been a complete waste of time and money.  The sandwich was a little different.  It seemed to be made out of a folded pizza crust. It was pretty tasty and fairly large considering the very low price!!! I would even consider returning if only for the Italian Sub.  I think it was priced under $5 and fed us both.  (Though we did have some bites of awful pizza and substandard wings to help get us through).

Chips and salsa were also complimentary - both green and red salsa had solid flavor without turning our mouths into raging infernos.

Menu is, as you would expect ""meat-centric.""  I had the carne asada, and it was a full 10 oz.  It came with two four (could have had corn) tortillas, and I am sure if I had asked Warren would have run right out with more.

My wife had the meatloaf, and when it arrived she rolled her eyes at the huge portion!  Most of it went home in a box and was just as good the day after.  She also commented the accompanying gravy was spot-on.

Sides are not included with the meal.  We had the green chili mac & cheese.  It was tasty, and plenty for two people to share.  They also provided beans, which were...beans.

So what to get at a place called Kung Fu Noodle? Well, being a Taiwanese style noodle restaurant, you can't go wrong with the beef noodle soup. Flavor wise, it's as good as beef noodle soup I've had in Los Angeles, although I will say that I wish they had more beef. Noodles are nicely done, and the broth is just wonderfully spicy with just a little hint of sweetness from the star anise/cinnamon and whatever other spices they put in there. It's awesome.

In addition, it's the only place in Tucson where you can get Taiwanese street food, like the ""Chinese burrito"" and various buns. I wasn't a huge fan of their ""hamburger"", but the Chinese burrito and the green onion pancake are awesome. Probably the only complaint is that they're pretty expensive, especially compared to other cities, but I guess when you're the only show in town you can charge what you like. Not a huge complaint; after all, I'm happy this place exists in Tucson.

Service is actually not bad considering it's a pretty authentic Chinese place (back in LA, if you go to a Chinese restaurant with good service, you can pretty much guarantee that it's either overpriced or caters to Americanized tastes). 

So overall, go and get the beef noodle soup, the green onion pancake, and the Chinese burrito and you most likely won't be disappointed!",2015-10-29 10:29:37,Kung Fu Noodle,Tucson,AZ,4.0,217,"Restaurants, Dim Sum, Chinese, Cantonese, Noodles, Taiwanese, Szechuan",37,4.08,0

I would give them a 4 stars because it's downtown and Jesus H Christ parking is a pain in the ass.  They need a more central location.  But I love them so much, I'm not going to bring their rating down.

I am a Ruby card holder, one level short of elite, so I do play here a lot.  Over the past few years there has been one specific player in this room (about whom I have complained numerous times in person and in writing in the past, to absolutely no avail) who has been banned due to boorish behavior from playing at the other main poker room in town.  He pounds on the table so hard that it literally vibrates.  He slurps served food like a hog at a trough. 
 Until recently he used to engage in lascivious behavior with his girlfriend during hands, but this has pretty much stopped.  He has continually bullied me and the dealers have said nothing.  He has put his hand on my chips in the past and moved them in and out -- for those who play poker, you know this is a cardinal sin.  I cursed at him in Spanish and the dealer admonished ME for raising my voice.  Last night, however, was the last straw.  He picked at me nonstop for three hours and finally I told him to ""chill out;"" he told me to Shut Up and the dealer just laughed at me.  This has been my favorite poker room for years.  The dealers are very good for the most part and the supervision is acceptable, but for some reason this ""person"" has been continually allowed to disrupt and dominate play in the poker room despite a number of complaints.  I am not the only person who feels this way.  Last night I let management know that if this person was not banned I would no longer be playing here.  The last time I wrote a complaint I received a form letter saying that the ""situation would be investigated"" but of course nothing has happened.  I have spoken personally with the new manager of the poker room and nothing has happened.  I have been trying to arrange a women's tournament at this poker room, but am putting my plans on hold because if this person is in the room his continual scatalogical language would make me as a sponsor look very bad among all the other female players.",2018-07-08 04:44:01,Casino Del Sol,Tucson,AZ,3.0,298,"Arts & Entertainment, Hotels & Travel, Casinos, Diners, Restaurants, Mexican, Resorts",15,2.0,0

 Also if you buy bread at sprouts, walmart, or trader joes (all with in walking distance) you should be a shamed of yourselves.

They moved and we were really bummed. We have been dining here since they moved and it seems to have gone down hill. We thought it was just growing pains so we have over looked some things but last night was it for us. 

We ordered two appetizers ( Sw Potato Fries and Fried Zucchini) 
Grilled Chicken platter with side salad
Steak platter for husband
Hot tea and Iced tea

Appetizers never came out
Salads were served but were the very basic for 2.99 Iceberg Lettuce, a sliver or two of onion, tomato slice and a small little thing of ranch dressing. 
barely through my small dinner salad the plates with dinner came out and were delivered by our waitress as if they were coming in for a landing as she put them on the table without waiting for anyone to move a single plate that they were eating from. 
ice tea was not refilled, my hot tea was not refilled nor was i asked if I would like more hot water. 

I didn't eat much of my dinner but out waitress would not have noticed.We saw her plenty when we were between the salad and dinner but  we did not see her after plates were served. We waited and waited for a ticket , she looked our direction and could not tell we were ready to leave i guess so I flagged another waitress who noticed the uneaten meal and asked if I wanted a box. I told her no, the chicken was dry, veggies were drowned in butter and mushy. Just a check please. I also pointed out the appetizers were not delivered. Our waitress did come by with the check at last and offered free desert and did remove charges for my meal and appetizers which was fabulous. I would say I would give it another go but previous experiences combined with other reviews and our experience last night make this a NO GO for future outings. Off we go to find another favorite.

2) Save yourself for what is some of the best bistro cuisine you've ever eaten in a wine store...or anywhere else for that matter.

This place has sentimental value for me, dating back to the old location.  In law school, when fine dining was a luxury, my friend and I would call ahead, sit at the bar on a Tuesday, Wednesday or Thursday to get the mussel deal.  Expertly steamed mussels and a glass of wine for $10.  It's now $12.50, but, hey, it's still a good deal.

Now I go there with my mother.  We always get the same thing, because if it's not broke, don't fix it.  We split the artichoke appetizer (artichokes stuffed with mushrooms on a bed of truffle oil infused polenta) and the roasted chicken with cippolini onions and mashed potatoes.  The restaurant always accommodates this request and we make up for splitting the meal by ordering wine.  And they have great wine.

Make sure you try the bread and compound butter.  It's a wonderful treat.

Dessert, whether on a plate or in a glass, is a great way to round out the evening.

This is the kind of place where you can sit long into the night, listen to great music, drink wine, and enjoy your company as much as the food...if your company is really really good.",2012-08-23 03:07:15,The Dish Bistro,Tucson,AZ,4.0,69,"Beer, Wine & Spirits, Arts & Entertainment, Wineries, Restaurants, American (New), Food",21,3.58,6

I must give them a lot of credit for their unique menu, impressive bakery and extensive array of brunch cocktails.  I also loved the rustic venue, with its high ceilings and wood floors.  Our waiter was a delight, he really made our experience a pleasant one.  

My only criticism is the food.  I was told that I have to order the french toast because it's their specialty.  I ending up getting the french toast of the day, which had whipped cream, blueberries, sweet cream cheese and brioche bread.  To begin with, the portion was way too big.  They gave me four huge slices and I'm the type of person who prefers less food, so that I can enjoy my meal without feeling engorged.  The texture of the french toast was too dry, it seems like they didn't soak it in the custard long enough.  There were very few blueberries and the combo of whipped cream and cream cheese was just too rich.  Maybe I ordered the wrong item!

My mom had the a.m. relleno which was the perfect portion size and very tasty, but a little too spicy.  My brother ordered the monte cristo with a side of biscuits and gravy.  Again, the portion was out of control!  Two giant sandwiches that were impossible to eat, with a ton of potatoes.  Altogether, just too heavy.  As for the drinks, my coffee and peach/orange mimosa was delicious, but the red sangria was far too sweet.

To top it off, this place is crazy busy on the weekend.  My family and I got there at 9am, so we only had to wait about 20 minutes.  After 10am, it was a zoo.

I'm probably in the minority here, but I think Prep and Pastry is trying too hard to impress their customers with lots of flavors and huge portions.  They should scale back and simplify.  I know it's brunch and it's supposed to be decadent, but you have to strike a balance.

Now for the chilaquiles, it was tortillas chips in bland tomato sauce. I don't know if restaurants are aware that they are supposed to be spicy, I mean common, its in the name ""CHILAquiles"". If your not going to make them spicy, then atleast add some flavor to the tomato sauce. I had to add some of the salsa to make them taste better.

Seriously though, it's amazing. I never wait long, even in a large party, the staff is always friendly, occasional screw up aside, they always fix it and fix it fast.

Service - 4.5/5.  They are all very pleasant and very accommodating, and smiley.  Though sometimes a couple of minutes off on delivering the check, they are a pleasure.

Food - 5/5.  The mussels, Beef Wellington, Sweetbreads, Salmon, and ESPECIALLY the Crepes Suzette tableside - all perfectly prepared, time and time again.

Price - 5/5.  You can enjoy tastes for just $5.50 per plate in the red domed room, but even the rest of the menu PERFECTLY prices the exquisite food at and average of $23 per entrée - worth every cent.

To start, I would not call this ""traditional"" Asian or Chinese cuisine but it's not Panda Express style either. You have a great fusion of Asian/American cooking that is just oh so tasty.

1. One of us ordered a egg omelette and the inside came runny.  When you have spinach and runny eggs not the best combination. 
2. They were out of sausages so the Hubbard newbie was trying to pick something else out.  Went around and took all other orders and said they'd be right back. They went and served another table and forgot to come back. The order did not get put in as the ticket was incomplete.  I chalk that up to being super busy and maybe a bad day for the wait staff. 
3. The beans that came with the food was dry

A lot of people really seem to like Caruso's, but I think it's not really that they genuinely like the food or the service so much as they like the convenience (location) and the fact that everyone in town seems to know the name. 

We went with a big party a while back and while the whole thing was bad, here's a few highlights:

- Despite having a reservation for close to 20 people, we had to wait outside in the rain for up to 30 minutes for them to have our table ready. There wasn't enough room in the lobby for us all.

- One of our party ordered a special: seasoned chicken. It was served as just that, literally. No veggies, no sides, no condiments even. Just a chunk of chicken rolling around on an empty plate. 

- The service was unacceptably slow and food was served in waves instead of all at once. 

- The birthday girl was given one of those little complimentary sundaes which turned out NOT to be sundae, but a pile of whipped cream with a candle stuck in it. What? Who does this? Why not just NOT offer the free sundae. Way to say 'thanks for your business, but we have more important things to do than worry about making money'.

- Towards the end of the night, one of the other guests in our 'room' (the dinning areas are divided up into smaller, more intimate rooms) got extraordinarily drunk and started arguing with another guest at a neighboring table. The one-sided argument escalated into the drunk woman screaming obscenities and vulgarities about the shocked guest's vagina (yes, her vagina) while the waitstaff and manager looked on. No one did anything. No one asked the drunk woman to leave. Instead, our entire table and the victim and her date left, shocked.

The entire casino is very clean.  The reason I don't like going to casinos very much is because of the cigarette smoke.  In Casino del Sol, though, they have enough air blasting through the place that the smoke isn't very prominent at all unless you're sitting right next to someone actively smoking.  Huge plus for non-smokers!

There are lots of bathrooms, and it seems like they're always clean, even though I don't ever recall seeing any cleaning crew.  It's like magic here or something.  

The layout flows really nicely.  It's not just a giant room full of slot machines.  There are hallways and different rooms and sections that really give the space a nice charm to it.  The ceiling is a color changing sky, which also makes the space unique and fun.  I think that's my favorite part!

There are plenty of restaurants to choose from (and there's no tax to pay on the reservation!).  They cover most price ranges, from a simple deli, to a fancy steakhouse.  There's also places for snacks, like FrozAN.  There's even two Starbucks!

Broke out the iPhone and found the next closest Indian restaurant...Shere Punjab! Unassuming in a musty strip mall, we walked and were pleasantly surprised to find a cute little restaurant  bustling on a Sunday afternoon! 

We were seated right away and informed about the buffet. We checked it out before we decided and were pleased to find Chicken Marsala, White Rice, Aloo Gobi (my fave), Tandoori Chicken, Saag Paneer, Curry beef, Naan, vegetable samosas, fruit, salad and a few other things I don't recall. 

We tried a little bit of everything and it truly was all delicious. The samosas were crispy with PERFECT vegetable filling. The Aloo Gobi was fantastic, the Tandoori chicken was excellent.

The decor wasn't anything out of the ordinary. Beautiful Indian paintings and shiny, glittery animals. Lots of mirrors. Not for the faint of ego. 

The service was good...our water glasses never went dry. Though, we never got a check. I had to go up to the counter and she didn't know how to ring up the check. She learned. No worries. I'm all for educating. :)

Apparently, there's a whole page of rules that each customer must abide by. And one of them is that no one is allowed to join your table once you're seated. I was not aware of any of these rules, and while I was driving there, I invited a friend to join myself and three others. When l arrived, the four of us were seated. My friend then responded and said that she would join us. However, I was then informed on the rule that no one could join once we were seated. My friend arrived 20 minutes later, and the waitress immediately walked over and told her that she could have her own table by herself. This was ridiculous----we asked for the manager, and told him that it was our first time, and asked if they could be understanding and make an exception.  After a few minutes of discussion, they then said that they would make things right and that she could join our table, but the wings would be full-price. Full-price?? Really?? What a slap in the face!! It felt like we were on the ""Soup Nazi"" episode of Seinfeld!!  ""No soup for you!!!""

I have to say my wife and i were very nervous going to Claim Jumper for dinner w/ some friends for a birthday party being wierd vegans and all.

Suprise!

Not only did they have things to eat, well OK just a couple, but they were very tasty. I had the Thai coleslaw and some fries $8 cause i wasn't all that hugry. and my wife had the Mediteranean Citrus Salad $9 and with a huge tip cause i work for tips and I give huge tips it was $26. Yes a little pricey but well worth it to be w/ friends and have  a great time.

The only bad things were the super long wait to eat, but it was sunday @ 6 so that is to be expected, and no vegan desert. Sigh:( Oh well I've been trying to lose some LBage so i'm doubting I would have wanted one of those gargantuan things anyway. They did look amazing though.

Great job CJ, we r pleasantly suprised and will return in the future for a partay!

Maybe I will start a new list, Best Vegan in unexpected places!

The atmosphere was small and quiet. We were there @ about 1:30 PM on a Sunday.  There were several other patrons but it was non-intrusive.  My husband and I were able to hold a conversation without issue.  We had a pleasant and helpful young man take our order. He was our waiter and was very attentive. 
 As an appetizer, we had the amazing sizzling rice soup which was a meal in itself. We were expecting a little broth with maybe a scallion or two. It far surpassed that, it was full of many yummy vegetables and even had meat in it (beef and chicken I believe). It was more than two people could eat and still eat your entree.  Portions here are very generous.
For my entree, I ordered the Pho which was listed as beef and I was able to get chicken.  My husband ordered combination lo mein. My husband has a large appetite but was not able to finish his either.  We left with a box full of leftovers that will cover me for 2 more meals, and possibly him as well.   The food was served hot (temperature) and very fresh. They do have spicy options, but this is what we ordered. 
They do deliver to the surrounding area. We will be moving to the area next month and were just trying it out, and we were not disappointed. For my husband and myself we spent $33 without tip. I think that is quite a bargain considering how many more meals we will still get out of it.  If you don't want leftovers, I recommend splitting entrees.

They have a very elegant website and that was part of my decision to go. I was underwhelmed. The ambiance was that of a mini-mall diner. Plastic menus are not appealing to me but these were even dirty, as was the table and several other tables in the indoor section I took a table in. There was noticeable crumbs and stuff on the floor as well. After watching my waitress cart a huge tray of food out to the patio (the patio dining area fronts right on the parking lot for the mall, and so did not appeal to me) I decided the place was understaffed, which may also explain the slowness and lack of coordination in the kitchen. I ordered there Provencal special with added hash browns and a side of bacon. The hash browns were outstanding and well worth the $1.75 additional - if I had a normal portion! As it was I received what seemed to be a half order or a child's portion of the most enjoyable item on my plate.

The first thing I received was my coffee. I ordered my coffee black expecting to receive a french roast but the coffee was bland and disappointing. It came with  plastic creamers another disappointment in a ""french"" cafe. The mini baguettes that came with my breakfast were embarrassing they were similar to frozen diner rolls from the supermarket. Really absurd when a so-called ""french bakery"" is sharing the same space with your ""french caffe"". On the way out I bought a Peach Turnover on the bakery, the crust was pretty good but there were only 3 tiny slices of peach inside. Overall the food was ""OK"", overpriced, and over hyped. I ordered the side of bacon because the website declared that Ghini's serves ""thick sliced maple cured bacon"". Instead I received 3 slices of thin-sliced Oscar Mayer or equivalent bacon for $4.50.

Worst of all my breakfast arrived but no bacon, I went ahead and started on my breakfast and by the time the bacon arrived I was almost finished - I should have sent it back and saved the $4.50 but the waitress was nice and I just let it go.

I ordered the vegetable enchilada dinner plate and was served two dry, flavorless flautas (think of a tortilla wrapped around a sliver of zucchini and oven baked) and a half cup of rice. For five bucks, it would have been a mediocre appetizer. For a fourteen dollar entree, it was a joke.  My husband forked over all the fries that accompanied his burger in attempt to supply me any substance. 

Other reviews mention fresh bread and butter - none was offered to us.  The restaurant website notes live music and outdoor seating around fire pits - also, not this evening.  The place was empty in peak hour, save some folks at the bar at the hotel for a convention. 

If the service was warm, or the food heartier, or flavorful, or the prices more practical, or the atmosphere less a downer,  I could be forgiving. Instead I went back up to my room at the adjacent Sheraton and drank a far more satisfying $9 bottle of wine.",2013-01-06 08:50:09,Fire + Spice Tucson,Tucson,AZ,3.5,41,"Mexican, Tex-Mex, Restaurants",55,3.76,1

just went back this past weekend to celebrate my brother and his new fiancee's engagement. i ordered the provencial - which is pretty much two thick slices of tomato and two eggs. I paid $8.25 for that.... well 2 buttermilk biscuits too. it was a nice, fresh, healthy breakfast, but... not worth the price tag.

the bro and husband both got the corned beef hash. they were starving, so I didn't try it as I didn't want to lose a finger. they seemed satisfied, but neither was raving. new sis-in-law-to-be had the italian omelette, which was just ok. 

the service was.... pretty atrocious. it took FOREVER to get our food. they mixed up part of our order. and in general it seemed as if the two servers were confused and forgetful as they scurried around. they were nice, just not on their A-game, I suppose.

and the restroom??? is a strange large room. they have one of those helper toilet seat things, that you can roll on top of the toilet for those that need assistance sitting down and standing up.... which is nice for those that need it, but gross for everyone else, as that is the FIRST thing you see when you open the bathroom door.

This rating leans more to 3.5 than 3, but had to round down because the food was more dissapointing than the absolute, amazing service.

Don't get me wrong... The food isn't bad, and to find a spot that does Menudo on a weekday, almost unheard of, but here El Sur does, with a blanco and a regular version. Where this was dissapointing, was there were was waaaaaaay more hominy (garbanzo beans) than actual tripe. This is sad, because the flavor was good, just an excessive amount of hominy. So if you're ok with that kind of ratio, please try, because MaMa in the back makes it right.

I also got a cabeza quesadilla. The meat was flavored wrll, but a little on the  dry side, which is awkward for such a fatty piece of meat. I did really enjoy it though.

The service was AMAAAAZING though. The waitress and waiter we're heavily attentive. Super nice. It really doesn't get much better than that. 

Maybe it's my comparison to SoCal spots that makes this place 3 stars instead of 4, but unfortunately that's the truth of things, and El Sur was put at that disadvantage.

Would I return? You bet. I want to check out the rest of their Caldos and dinner plates. My brother said the Asada plate was delicious, I may want to try a flauta or something.

The space heater was on, but it was unnecessary on such a lovely day, so I asked if it could be turned off and the obliging young man did.  The menu is extensive and enticing.

Alan ordered the tri tip slider, a house made cheddar biscuit, scrambled egg, arugula, jalapeño jam, served w/ country hash.  He ordered coffee and I ordered Lady Earl Grey tea.

The tea was served in a French press-type device.  We had whole milk on the side for both coffee and tea.  My tea cup was tall, graceful white porcelain.  The contents of the press just filled it.  The tea was very tasty.  When our dishes arrived they looked beautiful.  My sandwich contained tea smoked tomato, pulled mozzarella, brie,
parmesan rubbed bread, mint cashew pesto.  It was luscious and generous enough to share bites w/ Alan and still be too much for me to finish.  The tomato bisque was dark and subtly smokey, w/ occasional chunks of tomato.  It was my childhood comfort food grown up and elegant.  Alan gave me a taste of his biscuit and it was delicious.  He loved the dish, although he found the finely diced potatoes disappointingly bland, lacking onions, peppers or anything else to give them interest.

--Happy hour prices on the drinks (not food) last as long as a live band is playing. (But....see below)
--Awesome veggie tacos - but they are not on the menu, ask your server to ask the kitchen if they will make them. They officially stopped them but have made them for me when I asked.
--Nice space- has mellow outside tables and couches, fire pits, and is poolside; - has interior bar area with TV's (sports and news going at the same time on different tv's.)

CONS:
--Happy hour drinks are SUPER weak!! Maybe a splash of liquor. Better to order a shot AT the bar so you can watch it being poured.
--Live music crowd....interesting....a VERY mixed crowd of 40+ folks of all sorts. Not a classy or, um, charming crowd, sort of...um, just, be open minded and go with the flow!
--Bathrooms are freakishly far from the bar/restaurant! A waiter had to lead me down this maze of hallways. I was honestly not sure I would find my way back on the first try! Weird.

PRO or CON? YOU DECIDE!
--Live music = interesting! The couple Friday evenings I went, there was this super lounge-y group playing (Edna and Ely B-Cool) and the singer is a real character.

Real reason I go to local fairs is for the fry-bread. I also get really excited when I have out-of-town guests and they're interested in visiting the San Xavier Mission (fry-bread stand heaven!!!) 
Well the manna has finally fallen on the NE corner of Saint Mary's and Grande. I no longer have to eat my fry-bread standing, walking and fighting off bees (other fry-bread lovers will know what I mean). 
Located in a small, simple building formally occupied by a Mexican eatery, the current occupants have cleaned it up, repainted and are now open for business.  Other places in town do have frybread on their menus, but it seems as if they're almost an afterthought. Tucson, being so rich in Native American culture has waited long enough. We needed a place that allowed this star dish to shine. 
The recipe for fry-bread is simple, but the knowledgeable touch is not. In the wrong hands, frybread can be tough and overly greasy. 
This place gets it oh-so-right!
Hot, puffy, chewy and well...slightly greasy (but in a good way) is one way to describe the dessert fry-bread we tried first. We chose a plain one with honey (classic in my opinion). 
Later we tried the Indian taco (refried beans, lettuce, tomatoes, shredded cheese and a tasty little red salsa on the side). Mmmm!

Gusto is really starting to grow on us, we have now gone maybe 8 times in 3 years and most recently a month ago. The al dente pasta at Gusto is hard to beat in Tucson, it is predictably nearly perfect every time. My wife likes the crispy eggplant parmigiana with side of angel hair pasta and I really like the bolognese sauce for some reason and have ordered it with different pastas. It is a  simple dish but very well seasoned. One of the nice things about the wait staff at Gusto is that they are happy to ask the chef to substitute any dish or cook up veal scallopini even if not offered that night. 

Five stars for Vivace but easy four stars for Gusto. The difference? Ambience is important to me. 




Went to Gusto last night after a two year gap to see if things had improved. Food was actually quite tasty and service was good. We had Ceasar salad, tasty but slightly wilted, pasta bolognese and eggplant parmigiana. The pasta was a pleasant surprise and the eggplant was tasty with a crispy crust.

We were afraid this would be a popular night and the restaurant would be full.  It wasn't.  After reading all the reviews, I discovered there weren't too many great reviews.

Five of us ordered the corned beef and cabbage special.  We've had plenty of corned beef at many Irish restaurants in the past plus cooked our own. It's one of our favorite Irish dinners.   The corned beef has been almost always cut thicker, more on your plate, juicy and delicious. I've got to say this was absolutely the worst corned beef my husband and I have ever had.

I thought the carrots, potatoes and cabbage were very good.  However, the corned beef was skimpy, cold, over cooked, dry and nearly tasteless.   It was cut about as thick as a piece of paper.  Thus, with it being so thin, there was no flavor left in it.

I used to absolutely love Claim Jumper, but I'm going to talk about why I was disappointed during my recent visit. 

Part of the experience of Claim Jumper used to be the ambiance created by the mechanically driven belt fans throughout, the knickknacks on the walls, and the pretty authentic big western US / Colorado style perpetuated by the huge wooden beams, the rock fireplaces, and gigantic booths. The Tucson location, however, really lacks a lot of that character and instead does it halfway. It feels like a big restaurant that's too open, too noisy, and full of people who are there to engorge themselves with epic quantities of food.

I used to count on it for delivering very big portions, but during a recent visit I was disgusted to find out that the recession is apparently also hitting them hard. I ordered a cup of my favorite French Onion soup, and what came was barely 50% of the size of the cup even 2 months ago. I was taken aback that Claim Jumper would shoot its most prominent marketing point (insanely huge portions) point blank in the temple with such a decision. I haven't ordered the bowl size portion yet, but I fully expect that I'd get what used to pass for cup sized. 

The rest of the food is merely meh, burgers are superb and the salads are hearty sized, steaks are also better than average, but something about it doesn't leave me wowed. I used to get that from the French Onion, but now that it's obvious they're cutting back, I feel wrong about it.

Second to last time I came, I ordered the Chocolate Motherlode Cake on a whim since it's a very, very rare treat (due to its heart-stopping 3203 calories, and somehow 2616 grams of sodium), but they told me they were out! (! again !) Disappointed, I told the server that myself and the table guests would pass on desert (since we were all bummed at learning they were out of their signature cake). But the real icing on the situation was that 5 minutes later, as I waited for the check, another server walked right by our table with a slice of what was unquestionably Motherlode cake. What the heck, Claim Jumper? Thanks for that slap in the face.

To be honest, I don't know why I keep coming back. All the menu options take years off my anticipated lifespan (if you want to ruin your appetite, flip to the back of the drinks menu and realize that most menu options are 2 or 3 times the 2200 grams of salt recommended as safe by the FDA for healthy young adult males, the most of which is the Ham and Spinach Quiche with 6952 grams. I almost want to order it and see if I can feel the death course through my veins. Mmmz I might do it). But see what I mean? The whole draw of the place is how overwhelmingly huge and over-the-top most menu items are. I somehow keep coming back because it's the worst food possible for me, but... I like it.

She's obviously not racist and if you take a look at all she has done in the Tucson community, you can see that she has a big heart.

Sort of pricey for a small side of guacamole, but none of us were disappointed, as the chips and salsa were free.

This place is clean, casual, friendly, and overall reasonably priced. They also have numerous seafood options on the menu, including Mexican fish and shrimp cocktails, even oysters- though none of us was feeling quite so adventurous as to try one of the seafood cocktails or dishes. 

As I said, if you're in the area- this place is definitely worth trying... Be aware that for parties of 6 or more, they do add on the tip. Our check, with tax and (added on) gratuity came to $85 for a party of 6. We each had a beverage ($2.25 for horchata and $1.99 for soft drinks), and no one had dessert.

We decided to try them out tonight.  They've been open a couple weeks, so they've had plenty of time to get things in order.  How hard can fast food be?  Apparantly very.  We waited over 30 minutes for our food and when it finally arrived, our order was wrong.  My husband then had to wait another 10 minutes for his sandwich.  The woman at the table next to us waited even longer and her entire order was screwed up.  Some people were waiting up to 45 minutes for FAST food.

As far as the food, it was ok but nothing special.   They have one soda fountain with one button to select your drink, so there was always a line to get a drink and it came out so foamy, it only filled half your cup and you had to wait a while to fill it the rest of the way.

It wasn't breaded like a cheap Italian restaurant would give you. Overall I'd say you should check this place out. The staff is very friendly and intuitive. We never had to ask for a refill with our drinks but at the same time my server didn't continuously ask us if we needed anything. So, great experience.

We were seated and looking around I noticed 2 large parties but a lot of staff so I was not too worried.  We waited a few min for our drink order.  The menu looked good.  We both ordered a filet one medium the other medium well.  Meals come with beans and tortillas we also ordered the fries and slaw as a side. I'll say there was only a few reasons they got even a 2 star from me.  The slaw was amazing and the fries were pretty good too. And the actual cuts of meat were good. Now to the bad. Plates brought to our table missing the beans then we cut into our steaks mine was barely medium on the verge of medium rare. My wife's medium well came out medium rare at best honestly closer to rare.  I finally got our waitress attention and told her about the cooks on the steak and the beans that were missing from both plates. She took my wife's steak that she was now giving to me since it was so underdone back for more cooking. She brought back 1 order of beans and said they would be out shortly with the steak. A few min later one of the chefs dropped the plate in my lap and said you want to check to see if this is better I glanced at it already a little and noded and said yes. My plate came back missing the tortilla and the steak was medium rare still. To say I was disappointed is a understatement.  For a place that prides itself in being a steakhouse I'm sad to see they can not even cook a steak propery.  I refuse to send food back twice in my opinion if you can't get it right first 2 times how can I think you will on the third time.  Sad thing was they had every other table in the joint full and watching everyone else you could tell that the 2 large parties were getting the better service. Our waitress was pleasant and nice however her service was par at best.  All in all this place is a disappointment in my book.

I've never been here and brought my 76 year old mother who has a walker and Stage 3 Cancer to make a memory for us.

We were having slow progress to navigate the crowded, even though we were in the front of the line (almost behind the entry gates). For the most part people were nice. 

I ended up needing to get some help and approached a woman in a maroon vest as I assumed she worked for the casino rather than someone in a red shirt that said ""Event Staff."" The first thing I noticed was the roll of the eyes when she saw my mom. 

The girl had a lanyard on, but the lanyard was conveniently turned over and you couldn't see her name. After talking with her for about 5 minutes, I asked her name. She refused to tell me stating I didn't need her name. I can't even begin to describe the frustration with this rude woman.

I finally just gave up trying to get her to help me because she flat out turned around and walked three steps away from me to avoid speaking to me any longer. 

Once I had my mom settled, I went to purchase a bottle of water. It was about 20 minutes later. I saw the same employee (again with her lanyard turned over) being difficult to another guest. If I'd have seen her lanyard or gotten her name I'd have made a formal complaint about this woman. Obviously, there's a reason she wears her lanyard turned over.

However, having a more adult palate and just changing tastebuds, Panera is, in the world of sandwiches, just a-ok.  For the same amount of money you can buy a fresh, bigger sandwich at Baggins.  I do like that they have the you pick two combo - nowadays I typically get a salad and soup and my husband will get a sandwich and chips.  He will finish off about half my salad as I prefer to load up on the soup :)

I do enjoy their pastries, especially their cookies (peanut butter chocolate chip and snickerdoodle for the win!)

In fact, I'm now IN the Oracle location writing this review while savoring their delicious chicken noodle soup and really regretting not buying a chocolate chip cookie.

So why, you ask, the four star review. Well, it has nothing to do with their food and everything to do with the fact that it says Paradise Bakery on the outside but apparently is not, in fact, a Paradise Bakery. At least that's what I've come to understand from the cashier that would not take my Paradise Loyalty card. 

For all of you that may not know it, Panera Bread Company bought 51% of the outstanding stock in Paradise Bakery & Café Inc. in 2006. Panera really hadn't made any changes to Paradise Bakery until 2011. Since about May they've been making changes to the food, which I haven't really minded but this loyalty card thing really irked me.

I was at the other Paradise Bakery in Tucson just yesterday and they took my loyalty card then, so I know it's not a change in policy. It's just this location (that was opened under panera bread co.) that won't take it.

Why post the Paradise Bakery sign outside if it's really just Panera.

For the price, I'll keep going to In and Out, better burger, better price, and no waiting. Sunday afternoon we were going to stop again (already been here earlier in the week), the drive thru line wasn't out on Speedway, so thought it might be a short wait. We pulled in, only two cars in front of us. Still, ended up waiting almost 15 minutes for the two cars to go, so we finally placed our order, at 1:53pm. It took from 1:53pm until 2:16pm to get to the drive thru window to pay. Once we paid, we waited at the window for another 15 minutes! I finally got somebody's attention and asked why, after 45 minutes, they still didn't have a BBQ sandwich and a bowl of chili ready! That's all we ordered. He apologized and went to check. Came back 5 minutes later with a lukewarm BBQ sandwich (couldn't taste the BBQ), and a warm bowl of chili. No spoon, no napkins. Obviously the food was prepared when we ordered it 45 minutes prior. What's worse is that once we got our food, we still couldn't leave because there were two cars between us and Speedway still waiting for their food! The guy inside finally came out and asked them to move over to the parking lot so we could leave. We spent more than ONE HOUR in the drive thru. Believe me, the food was definitely not worth that kind of wait. If I knew I'd be spending an hour in the drive thru, I would have opted to go dine at Olive Garden. When looking inside, there were several employees walking around and talking to each other. None of which showed ANY sense of urgency. They need to seriously re-think how they want to operate their drive thru operation, not to mention the parking lot. They should reroute the drive thru so that it does NOT go out to Speedway. Makes it very difficult for people who want to park and go inside. 
Our visit earlier in the week went slightly better, still spent way too much time in the drive thru, although the BBQ sandwich tasted much better and was hot on our first visit, and had the right amount of BBQ sauce. 
After our last visit, I doubt we'll be back anytime soon. Hopefully they can figure out how to run a drive thru, and maybe establish an escape route so you're not stuck behind other cars waiting for their food. Very, very frustrating. There is no food that is worth that kind of waiting, and the food here is not even that good. Don't waste your time. Go someplace where you can get your food while it's still hot... like In and Out.

I""m giving 3 stars because the food was very good, but our server was terrible and really was the reason my experience was filled with frustration. 

I really like how this is a strip mall joint.  Good ones are usually 'hidden secrets'. Nothing ruins a good restaurant quicker than popularity.  I know it's counter intuitive, but as Yogi Berra said ""nobody goes there anymore, it's too crowded"".  Well, we arrived at 7 on a Wednesday night and the place was packed.  We were, ehem, pointed towards a table (I would say 'seated', but the employees were too busy to actually greet us and show us to the table) after about 15 minutes.  

I really love the atmosphere.  I'd call it ""Traditional Indian kitsch"" with its Taj Majal architectural flourishes and the paint-by-number Indian artwork.  The last time we dined there, which was a few years ago, I loved how it seemed to be run by an Indian family with the grade-school kids sitting quietly doing their homework, and a turban wearing grandfather manning the door.  This time, however, it seemed like the crew from Los Betos took over, and our particular waitress had no clue how to provide table service.  We were not greeted once we sat down.  Several minutes later a charmless lady approached us and asked if we were ready to order.  After going around the table taking our entrees, I had to point out that we would also like  to order some drinks.  The food came out pretty quickly, and then the beers, and I had to ask twice for the white rice that was supposed to accompany our dishes.  Not surprised that she messed up our order, but in a way that worked out to our advantage. She brought a random extra dish that we didn't order, but was delightful nonetheless.  We were not checked on again until about 10 minutes after we were all finished, with napkins on our plates.  

When you go out to eat it's not all about the food.  You are paying for the experience and bad service can be like a little too much salt in the curry.

This was our first time in after years of talking about going and we were very happy we went sad it took us so long. Monday night at about 5 pm door was opened as we approached we were told to sit wherever we liked it was almost empty not usually a good sign but started to fill up pretty quick. Water and bread (fabulous focacia) were brought emediatly and our wonderful waiter Max took drink orders right after that he and helpers kept filled throughout the meal and quietly checked on us often. He also took time to answer all or questions and make suggestions about choices and sizes like full size salad and entree might be to much advised house or Cesar Salad or maybe soup.  Shrimp Scampi appetizer was wonderful 5 or 6 very large shrimp in a to die for sauce, I saved it to dip bread in which were refilled often and without request they also have olive oil and fresh pepper grinder on tables a great touch for bread dipping. also had the famous Scordado Stuffed Mushrooms also very good. Tried both soups excellent and a Ceasars Salad great. Main courses of Fettuccine Alfredo with Chicken, Baked Meatballs and Farfalle and Penne with Sausage were all perfect. Comments about pasta being under done are from people who eat spaghetti from a can, they were all done perfectly al dente, to the bite, I'm sure if you like soft mushy they would do it on request. Prices moderate a little high as I feel for all Italian Restaurants but the portions were huge, even I brought half home I almost always clean my plate. Deserts good and shareable too.

Let me preface this review by disclosing that my usual stomping grounds are Los Angeles and Scottsdale, the brunch capitals of the West.  And call me, #basic but I love brunch more than most things.  My friends and I came here because Prep and Pastry was way too crowded (1 hr wait, no thank you!) and Ghini's had none.  The interior is cute and French-themed with painted trellises, stained glass art, and artfully placed wine bottles, which would please any Francophile.

I ordered the carafe of Bloody Mary, which I really enjoyed!  We got it Nola style so it was spicy, and the alcohol content was on point.  For my entree I got the spinach, ham and swiss crepe.  Not mind blowing but definitely not bad. I had some of my friend's croque madame. also not bad.  The stand out of this meal was definitely the bloody mary.

They were more than happy to accommodate for all the outside requests we had.  One of my friends is notoriously picky and always customizes her order.  the servers at Ghini's took it in stride.

The best part of this cafe is that you can split the check really really easily!  I wish the brunch spots in LA would adopt this policy.  Added on a whole star for the ease of this payment scheme.  You just go to the front, tell the cashier what you ordered and you pay for it. 

There is also a bakery appended to the other side of the cafe.  They sell macarons, cookies, huge pull apart cinnamon rolls, and tarts.  The cookie I got was ok.",2014-09-28 00:53:44,Ghini's French Caffe,Tucson,AZ,3.5,427,"Restaurants, Food, Breakfast & Brunch, Sandwiches, French, Bakeries, Salad",191,3.99,59

I take my first bite, and the rosemary, and french toast was a very interesting taste I've never had, and I liked it. However it still had that faint burnt taste, but still very good. The chicken on the other hand, had NO flavor. I ask my girlfriend how her food was, and I see this look of disappointment.

Decor is functional. The two ramen dishes we had were very tasty and the slice of pork was flavorful and tender. Service was friendly and quick. Most dishes are priced in the $11 to $14 range. All dishes use a pork flavored broth except one vegetarian dish and one chicken dish. The seafood selection also uses the pork broth per the wait staff. The noodles are wheat-based and was told there are no plans to offer a non-gluten alternative. One observation. The vehicle parking area is limited and the parking spaces are tight. When we left the restaurant we observed two patrons exchanging car insurance info.

If you don't look closely, you'll miss the place; it sits in a strip mall mixed in with other small businesses and a church if I remember correctly!  It was a little after noon on a Sunday and so most of the crowd had thinned out so we were able to sit down immediately.  Place fit's the text-book description of a dive: mixed and eclectic assortment of tables/chairs/decorations and knick-knacks but was really cool looking at all the things. 

 HUGE MENU!!  Was hard to decide to choose because everything sounded so good!  Kids stuck with pancakes and eggs while my wife and I decided to lean towards the Native American/New Mexico influence with the Breakfast Burro and the Chorizo Fundido omelet.  WOW!  Both were delicious!  The owner was so nice as well; came over and talked to us for a bit and then brought over a new dish/recipe she was trying and asked for our opinion on it.

When we arrived, the place was packed. Parking was at a premium, but we wanted to eat in, so we finally found a place to park. There was a long line inside, and it was moving VERY slowly. We were on line for approximately 18 minutes before we finally made it to the counter. Once there, we placed the order we'd had plenty of time to think through. We both ordered the Lota combo. He asked for nothing on his burger except cheese and onions; when asked if they had any other sauces for the burgers, like maybe, 1000 island, they did not. I have gluten issues, and asked if they have gluten-free buns; they do not. I ordered mine bunless. The combo comes, according to the menu, with a large drink and a large fries. Their large drink is something like 30 ounces, but their large fries is smaller than a regular size at certain large chain restaurants. The price was fairly reasonable, no real complaint there.

We went off and found one table to sit down at to wait for our food. The dining room is far too small for the numbers of people wanting to check out this new restaurant (that may not be a problem for long, however). There are no salt or pepper shakers, no available napkins on the tables or in the dining room.

There was a young man running orders out to the tables, and it was at this point that I realized how backed up they really were. Our order number was 844; the runner was bringing out orders in the low 830's. People who had already found tables before we entered the restaurant were just getting their food (at this point, we'd already been in house approximately 25 minutes). It took approximately another 15 minutes to get our food. When we got it, our first disappointment was the fries. Not that they were unpleasant; they were not particularly hot, more along the line of lukewarm, and they could have used a bit more salt. When he opened his burger, there was cheese, but no onions. He had to go to the counter for it, and wound up with the equivalent of the small round of onion. The patty was thin and dry, and we were both disappointed at the fact it was only one patty. The picture next to the Lota combo clearly shows a double patty burger. When he asked about it, he was told they have had a large number of complaints about that.

Over all, the experience was far less than all the hype had led us to expect. We won't be going back. If we want a good burger, we'll go to Graze across the street.",2016-04-14 05:06:54,Blake's Lotaburger,Tucson,AZ,3.0,225,"Hot Dogs, Burgers, Restaurants, Fast Food",6,3.67,0

While we waited I started with a prickly pear Margarita. It was delicious and fabulously priced at $7. Getting a drink at the bar was easy and fast despite the crowd. 

When we were seated we decided to do a little sharing with our dishes since we literally wanted to try everything. We started with the maple bacon cronut. I was honestly really disappointed! I love cronuts so much and was really looking forward to this. It would have been much better if it was served warm! It was cold, dry and felt stale!

Once the doors opened I was quickly seated at a table for three, and they gladly accommodated my party of three when we asked to be seated at a booth instead. Overall, the service was satisfactory, albeit slightly scattered and overburdened.

I ordered the Roasted Black Garlic Tonkotsu and I quite enjoyed it. Good flavor and toppings and just the right amount of salt -- I drank the broth at the end, which is something I won't do if it's too salty. Portion size was good, as I left feeling sated, but not full.

Price wise, I don't mind paying ~$11 for a bowl of good Ramen, although I do hope they'll be able to lower the price a little in the future. I will, however, note that the drink prices are unreasonably high -- no one at my table ordered drinks because of it.

If you can get in line early or don't mind waiting, a while I'd definitely recommend trying Raijin Ramen at least once, as in my opinion it's one of the better options for Ramen in Tucson (and currently my favorite, although I still need to try others)...you might want to skip drinks in favor of a lower bill or spending the money on appetizers instead, though.

Yes, it's *owned* by McDonald's, but there is clearly no influence on the food from anything related to McDonald's. In fact, Chipotle should be insulted to have its name spoken in the same sentence.

The portions are HUGE. I usually get the chicken fajita burrito- get it with everything on it and it's incredibly tasty and very filling. If you want something lighter, go with the tacos or possibly a burrito bowl (burrito minus the tortilla).

They also sell chips with salsa or guacamole, and beers and margaritas (looks like some sort of pre-mixed margarita, haven't tried that myself). The chips and sides are expensive, so I just stick with a burrito and a regular drink.

 This isnt your normal Claim Jumper, at least not anymore. I have gone there three time in the last 10 month before finally deciding no more chances. Its been black listed in our family. 

I am not sure if this particular restraunt is under new managment or if indeed the entire chain has undergone a menu change, but the results are very poor compared to years before even at the same location in the past. 

Out of the three times i have gone over the last year, I got one quality meal where I felt it was worth the price. 

The other two times were really bad, like burned ribs,  store bought box like quality mac and cheese, and some crazy appetizer. 

The appetizer was the worst. I think it called the Range Rattler. They  are breaded beyond belief with a raw like pepper layer underneath and a tastless cheese stuffing inside, somewhere they add overcooked shrimp. On top of that the appetizer came after the dinner.. maybe because it took so long in coating these monstrosities of deep fried flavorless flour.

Anyway, came in with the husband and our sons. Was open seating so we settled down and not even minutes later someone was bringing us menus, high chairs and taking drink orders. They bought out menus and crayons for my boys and were hanging around talking to my sons (people tend to do this often, they are really cute boys). Ordered BBQ wings, the standard burger, my husband got the Tucson burger and I got sliders and corn dogs for my boys. All food was cooked very well, had great flavor. The wings were very good and not too messy, I hate messy wings. The burger was cooked medium well just like I asked. We like all the tables were brought out warm chips and salsa both were very, good.

The manager was very sweet and kind, and honestly people just kept checking on us the whole time and again , she said she was missing her grand babies so she gave my littles a lot of attention but not in a creepy way.

cc-Nn6J9yWLHLWcRGhDwvw,bAP2g0spJ4GZp43EuLtA1g,tP8wd-9CrI_RkHK424oifQ,2.0,2,0,0,"Let me start by saying that a single experience does not represent the whole so.... I try to be fair and try places out a couple of times before writing a review. 

This said, where do I start? 
Ok I am going to start with the dining enviorment. The old location was more representative of the Paradise Branding and had a traffic flow that made sense. Order , walk down the counter and pay at the end. Condiments were located in eye view and were convienient. There was space for customers to walk by and etc. 

The new location is just well..... awkward! The entire counter is at the front. You cannot see how your food is prepared as it is prepared back in a kitchen area and then brought to you. This leads me to the next piece so ... you pay, you have your drink cup in hand and you have to look for the soda fountain because the only beverage station that is obvious is the coffee self serve. Not new customer friendly on this aspect. Once you find the station which is located behind the seating area it is small and crowded and the traffic flow is terrible with you standing there right in the servers path as they come out of the kitchen trying to deliver orders to tables. 

Next you must find a seat. seating arragement is awkward probably due to the location being in a space that is awkward shaped. This might be prime realestate due to the store having street side view for cars passing by but this killed the interior ambiance and seating arragements as well as traffic and work flow for both patrons and employees. 
This is a segway into the delivery of the food to your table. As a person who dines out regularly and is also a manager what I could not help but notice that waiters came out of a kitchen into a dinning area had particians on the backs of some of the booths, this makes it difficult for them to locate patrons or see numbers on the tables. This also leads to wait staff going around in circles confused as they try to find where the orders should be placed. I felt bad for them.

Lastly quality of the food. As far as being consistent with consumer expectations and meeting the brand expectations I give it a ( F) I visit Paradise Cafes all over the state and the one thing I can usually say is while service might be a bit inconsistent, food is generally meeting or exceeding standards. Lettace was ok and not packaged but..... toppings to a rather pricy salad were sparce as was the dressing. It honestly was like eating a bed of lettace without much in the way of topings or taste. I was hoping that the sandwhich I got would be better. The same sandwhich I ordered at the Chandler AZ location was very tasty and so I was looking forward to what I was about to eat and I did have an expectation it would taste the same. Not the case. The chicken again was sparse and the avadaco was fresh but it wasn't ripe, not even close. The Avacado was hard and tasteless. The bread also seemed a bit chewy even for sourdough and to be honest had the same texture on the crust as rawhide which was the analogy I provdided to the person I was dinning with. 

Lastly Customer Experience.....
I understand that Pannera has purchased some if not all Paradise Cafe locations. I use my catering card and rewards card currently at nearly all other locations in the phoenix area. I have dinned at Pannera in Las Vegas and I have their loyalty card also. The Tucson location is the ONLY location that tells me that since the buy out occured and the owners cannot make up their minds on how to merge the two corporations that they currently are not accepting any loyalty cards. 
If this is the case ok, but for the love of GOD can we be consistent? Again no other location has expressed this to me. If this is the case due to being a franchise then it should also be said as this makes the entire Paradise Brand look bad and patrons might have the same impression of non franchise locations. Pannera in LV also seems to be accepting their own loyalty card and again this location accepts neither. 

This is my third experience at this location and as another reviewer stated they did not fail to disappoint again in many aspects. I won't be returning to this location while in Tucson.",2012-07-08 02:06:31,Panera Bread,Tucson,AZ,3.0,128,"Sandwiches, Bakeries, Restaurants, Soup, Salad, Cafes, Food",115,3.58,4

When my food was delivered at the table, I specifically asked if the soup was vegetarian. Two women who delivered the food said it was.

It was not. They served a vegetarian chicken soup even after being specifically asked about it. 

I sent the soup back, and then had my meal interrupted an additional 2-3 times by their employees. Because their mistake necessitates them interrupting my meal to unpleasantly pseudo-apologize.

Some excuses given:
""We have a lot of new girls working here."" (I gave my order to a man.) (Also, you told me the soup was vegetarian when you delivered it)
""We ran out of the soup so we substituted another.""  At this point I replied that I would have understood it if the cashier had told me that they were out of the vegetarian soup.

We absolutely loved it. It's a gorgeous hotel which reminds me of Vegas. Part of the hotel also looks like the Venetian. Plenty of food options even for picky eaters like my 13 year old. There is a Starbucks inside the hotel for Starbucks lovers. 

Rooms were also beautiful. No complaints. We even got complimentary chocolates. Yummy.

SERVICE: They are notorious for their wait time on weekends as I'm sure other yelpers can attest to, but after enjoying a delicious meal here, I can see why! My group of 7 arrived around 11 and were told there was a 2 hour wait!! WHAT?! The place is rather small. It ended up being a little over an hour since some groups before us didn't want to wait. They do have some outside seating as well, and I recommend sitting at the bar if you're only 2 people. It's probably best to come with a group of max 4 people.

The two owners came by our table to say hello and thank us for coming by  and chat for a bit -- that doesn't happen every day! They were genuine and I could tell that they really put their heart into great service, atmosphere and excellent food. 

DRINKS: The mimosas are a must try! Great way to get your brunch time going and get happy :) I had the fuzzy naval and the other girls tried the blueberry one and Madras (guava).  I couldn't really taste much peach flavor in mine, but peach is a mild flavor anyway. I liked it either way - very tasty! 

FOOD: The menu is small but sufficient to find something interesting. After we ordered, one of the owners brought us a sample of their newest brioche french toast to get our opinion on it (see photo). It's not even on the menu yet!! It was a bit tart and not overly sweet.

The ONLY thing I didn't like about the menu is that since I never eat meat in the mornings, that cut out a lot of the options on the menu, as many items have duck, sausage or ham/pork. I had the omelette, which changes every day by the way. Today it had carrot purre, leeks, spinach, tomato slices and cheese, with springs of sprouts on top. It came with hashbrowns on the side. When I first saw the plate I thought it was very small, but it fills you up.  Everyone was speechless when the food arrived -- that's when you know the food is gooood :) Overall the meals were fairly healthy and satisfying for everyone.

The place is itself is a nice place to hang-out with a good vibe.

The beer menu is great though, with tons of local options. They have a few margarita choices that all sounded interesting and I loved mine. 
However, the food was just not good, especially for what you can get in this town for Mexican food. The tacos and burrito both just tasted dry, to the extent that we didn't even finish the burrito despite being voracious eaters normally.

what really annoys me to no end is when a restaurant establishment treats their loyal returning customers like crap. I go to this place 2-3 times a week dine in or take out after working out next door because of their convenient location. I tip very well and bring them easy business even though I've never really gotten any stellar service from this place.   

their take out policy is that they will make you get rice/ noodles/rice noodles in a separate container which is weighted so they'll charge you at least half a pound on just carbs, which is pretty $hady but okay I'll deal with it. 

so I kindly asked the lady today to put in a little chow mein with my rice noodles container (which is still weighted and doesn't make a difference to them either way other than to go out of their way to take away the satisfaction I might get from having both rice noodles and chow mein) and she refused. are you kidding me??????? what have you possibly got to lose from doing that??? i'm not substituting, not asking for extra, not asking to customize.    

a little business tip for you, or at least for that girl who was so unhelpful:  going out of you way a little to accommodate the customer goes a long way. funny just this morning I gave a speech to my office about good service and how a simple smile or gesture of care can really take a company far by building a strong returning client base. when I go during weekdays the restaurant is pretty dead and with all the competition in the area which all have a much wider selection of food it's hard to imagine why they would go out of their way to piss off their customers. The food I will add is decent, but I'm definitely NOT ever returning here. and at the end I asked the manager if I can have mixed the two and he says YES. way to go.",2013-10-06 03:13:50,U-Like Asian Buffet,Tucson,AZ,2.5,98,"Asian Fusion, Buffets, Restaurants",105,3.89,1

We ordered a bunch of different things, this being our first time here. He got chef's cut steak. I got carne asada.

The steaks were perfectly cooked, quality cuts of meat. The sides were all super flavorful; so it's hard to pick just one favorite (but get some bbq sauce on the side). 

Our server was very knowledgeable about the ingredients and when seeing we were on the fence about ordering a 3rd side (the esquites) offered to bring us a small taste of it. That way we were able to try a bunch of different things. He did his job professionally, but in a genuinely friendly way. 

The atmosphere was fun and clearly hip (by the decor). The energy level was simmering (even on a Sunday night). My only complaint would be the TV in the bar is visible in the dining room and can be distracting from the dinner.

I got up very early to take her to the hospital and although I had coffee, I hadn't eaten all day and was hungry. She is very particular about her food and loves their broccoli cheese soup. I am gluten free and if I eat here, I usually get a salad. So after she was released the hospital suggested she eat soup so I decided to run into Panama and get a take out order. She was very groggy and stayed in the car and I wanted to do it quickly. 
Anyway she was very hungry so I ordered a bowl (as opposed to a cup) of the soup and she's very particular about her order. I ordered her a sandwich to eat later that day. She like ham and Swiss cheese on a croissant with no mayo or mustard, just lettuce and onion. I asked for a quick recommendation for a gluten free salad, and the cashier recommended the green goddess salad. 
The order came out quickly (I would say maybe five minutes) which was great. They said everything like utensils etc were in the bag (which they were). I didn't look in the bag I just grabbed it and went out. The cashier had asked me if I wanted a large salad and I was so hungry, I said yes.
The total cost was $25.27 and there were no drinks. So $25.27 for soup, salad and a sandwich. 
So then I get her home, bring her in, bring the food and her purse and her hospital bag in and I get her ready to eat. I put her sandwich in the refrigerator and gave her soup to her and a spoon. I had told her I got her the bowl because she was so hungry but it was clearly a cup of soup. Then I took my salad out and it was SO tiny. I was convinced they gave me the smaller version because I've eaten salads there before and this was soo tiny, and was $9.89.
The salad was okay. I eat a lot of salads. It wasn't great but other than the size I have no complaints about it but certainly wouldn't pay $9.89 for it. 
I decided to call the manager. I also checked her sandwich first, which was exactly as she had ordered it. 
I decided to call the manager, John. I felt we had been given a cup of soup, instead of a bowl and I felt like we had gotten the smaller version of salad. Anyway, he was polite, looked up my ticket and asked me questions. I do think the soup was the wrong size but what was sad was the salad WAS the 'new size' of the large container, which is small. He was interested in making it right and asked me to ask for him next time we are there and he said he would make it right. I appreciate that but I personally won't pay $10 for that salad again.

We wanted to try something new for breakfast today so naturally I used Yelp!   
We live on the far west side, so this is not a resturant we would normally pass.  It is tucked behind the Gaslight Theater - probably why we never saw it before.
It is hard to know where to start, but here goes:

The outside:  very Americana, very quaint! 

The inside:  more Americana, very patriotic (we are both vets so we love it)!

The coffee:  I am very pickey about coffee.  I usually don't order it unless I know it is good.  My husband ordered a cup & assured me of it's quality, so I got a cup.  Great!  Not too strong & no ""burnt"" taste.  They also had the little flavored creamers!

The food :  My husband ordered the pancake breakfast with bacon & eggs.  He ordered his eggs over medium & he tells me they were perfectly cooked.  The bacon was good - not over or under cooked.

I ordered the Tucson scramble with home fries & biscuits & gravy.  Whoa....the scramble was a HUGE portion!  You could definitely share this - I took more than half home!  The eggs were seasoned & quite tasty.  The ham chunks were good.....not the ""sandwich""  ham slices that you get at some places.  The cheese was generous & evenly distributed.  
The biscuit & gravy was tasty.  You get a cup of gravy & one biscuit.....so here is my biggest issue (albeit not a big one).....you only get 1 biscuit.  I wasted half my gravy!  Did I mention it was tasty?  I hated to waste it!  I will admit I broke off pieces if the biscuit and ""dunked it"" into the gravy - maybe had I poured the gravy over the biscuit not that much would have been left.

Now...on to the best part... the home fries.  I usually can take 'em or leave 'em.  My husband doesn't like 'em at all.  We actually BOTH loved them.  Piping hot and really crispy on the outside.   The inside was a dream!  They were almost ""creamy"" on the inside.  That is the best way I can describe them.  There was a seasoning on them, too.  Hands down the best home fries I have EVER  had!

The service:  Wonderful.  Our cups never got to below half!

Honey/Cinnamon Fry Bread
Taco's deep fried with the ground beef in the shell
Menudo

The restaurant has specials such as on Tuesdays and Thursdays $1 Tacos, which are just as good as the non-special days.

Everything is so very fresh and made daily.

If you want a clean environment, good/quick service, courteous staff, reduced prices, amazing and hearty food, and a business that caters to your needs even when a mistake has been made, this is the restaurant to go too.

First mistake was that we sat inside, unfortunately it was raining outside so we missed out on what is supposedly a great patio.

The dingy and antiquated interior lighting was apparently installed the same time their famous ""copper marinara pot"" was; nearly 100 years ago.  

The waiter had been on the job for two days, clearly did not intend to make a career out of working at Carusos, and spilled red wine on the poor woman sitting next to us.  We opted for beer in bottles...

While reading the menu we noticed that the seafood Alfredo featured ""a mix of seafood""... right away that sounded fishy... however the staff identified this dish as one of their favorites, so I gave it a try and my wife braved the shrimp in Alfredo.

The entrees arrived in about 20 minutes and after we killed half a basket of what we believe was garlic butter with a side of bread we thanked the staff and surveyed the odd dishes placed in front of us.

The Alfredo sauce was green in color when it arrived... on both plates, which in some way gave me comfort as perhaps it was intended to be that way. Nevertheless, we gave it a try and found that both plates contained little crunchy shells from poorly cleaned and prepared shrimp.

Unfortunately I could go no further once the mushy imitation crab meat that dominated the ""mixed seafood"" dish slithered off my fork.  Now I've had great seafood linguine in the past but have never found a restaurant brave enough to tarnish their reputation by offering patrons soggy, slimy fake crab chunks in green Alfredo sauce...

The broth for the Tonkotsu is flavorful and taste similar to the style you would find at ramen restaurants outside of Tucson. Most of the other restaurants in Tucson that serve ramen are not able to replicate the Tonkotsu flavor accurately. The ramen toppings were also great besides for the sliced pork (chashu), which is on the smaller side and is very plainly seasoned. 

I also had issues with the portion size. The bowl is a lot smaller than what you find at other ramen places, and there is no option for a larger size or even to order extra broth.

You place your own order at the counter, take a number and they'll bring your order to your table.

It's a nice place to stop when taking a ride on the bicycle; grab a coffee, a cinnamon roll, or whatever looks good in their baked goods display.

I was pleasantly surprised by the clean edgy cool decor.  It is like rustic cowboy ranch meets semi posh meets wide open spaces.  High ceilings, not super cluttered and very casual yet classy feel.  We had made a reservation on Yelp but did not need it.  They have a lot of tables.  The parking could probably be an issue depending on when you came but we lucked out and found parking right away given it was 5 on a Friday.

The hostess was sweet and seated us at a table by the window and we were facing the bar as well as kitchen down near the end of the restaurant.  The reason I even call this out is that we had a great view of the entire restaurant which was not busy but there was a TON of staff, likely ready for a start of the weekend dinner rush.  Our server came right away and told us the specials and took our drink order.  He recommended the ""El Maestro"" cocktail.  I went for it, actually went for two of them.  SUPER tasty and spicy with tequila, sweet and sour, some OJ and jalapenos and fruit.  My only gripe is having 2 inside of an hour, I didn't even have a little buzz (low tolerance) which tells me they pour super light.  Annoying if you are throwing down 12 bucks for a drink.  

The Hubs ordered the Porterhouse, I ordered the Filet.  We got a few sides that you order separately and are not included  -- Mac & Cheese, House Potatoes, Calabasitas.  They bring you Charro Beans that are included along with warm tortillas.  So the steaks were great, super tender and tasty.  I did expect more from that Chile Verde Mac & Cheese (really dry), it was ""okay"" but the house potatoes was like their version of the scalloped potato and was seriously hardcore delicious.  We ended with the PB & Choco Tres Leches... different and it had chocolate and peanut butter, I can't ever say anything negative about that combo.

The service was odd -- the server who shall remain unnamed, even though I remember his name -- was friendly/nice but seemed awkward.  Maybe he was new, I have no idea but if you are working for a restaurant that has a semi pricey menu, you best be on the top of your game.  After he brought us our drinks initially, he stood over at the bar... like the whole time.  Someone else brought our food and got us situated with that... my El Maestro had been empty for at least 10 minutes, and he never once asked me if I wanted another.  My Hubs had to ask for refills on his Iced Tea, twice from people other than our server.  My steak needed a little more time on the grill, and if the Hubs had not waved him over he probably would have just walked back to the bar to hang out over there.  It was not until he brought my steak back that I was able to ask for another cocktail, 30ish minutes after the first one had been sucked dry. The server was not intuitive with his guests, period.  My guess is total inexperience, and this guy would be slaughtered in the server world in a bigger city.  The place was not busy at all, particularly being so well staffed, so give this dude some extra training?

I struggled between the 3 and 4 stars, and 3 stars won out based on the lack of service.  When I think about ratings, I have to put it in the context of the type of restaurant, price, etc.  If I am going to pay these prices, service HAS to be on point.  This is a nice Steakhouse with a Mexican flare and I am really glad I tried it, I am on the fence if I will go back.

I booked our trip as a last-minute getaway online, pricey but the rooms are nice and we like this casino so money is not an object. Casino Del Sol is about 2 hours from our home in Gilbert, when we arrived I was asked for my driver's license and credit card that I used to book the room, they could not find our reservation,claiming we did not have one. I could not find my confirmation email. Rene was our customer service representative and said we did not have a reservation and they were booked for the night. I told him I was sure that I had a confirmation but I needed to find it, it took me about a half an hour but I did find it. I came back up to the desk and showed him, the other girl next to him  showed him the reservation after I again gave them my credit card, apparently he did not know how to look up reservations, lucky me. In the meantime my husband found a hotel nearby to book the room thinking we did not have one so now we had to cancel that one,  no apology from Renee until I said don't you think you should apologize for screwing this all up? he was shocked and apologized but no feeling or acknowledgement that he did something wrong, making excuses the whole time. Thank God I was persistent in looking for my confirmation had we left and gone to another hotel I would have been charged for this room not even knowing that I do indeed have a reservation, scary! This did not start off our weekend Excursion with a good feel, bar service was slow and the measuring of the alcohol is ridiculous, don't give me a drip more than a shot you might not make any money on your liquor at a casino. As the casino got busier throughout the night it was almost impossible to get any kind of drink, lines down the hallway to get to the bar. Ridiculous, bartenders not really caring if they gave good customer service or any customer service at all as if they would never see us again, keep it up you won't see us again! We used to come to Casino Del Sol a lot a couple of years ago, we stopped and I didn't really remember why, maybe this is why, bad customer service. To the management, you really need a better program to encourage great customer service, all the employees seem like this is just a job and are not connected to the reasons why they should be friendly to the people who keep them employed. Everything seems like a hassle. Too bad Casino Del Sol you have the potential to be great. My husband also mentioned about how dirty and disgusting the bathrooms were, no one was keeping up the cleanliness, cigarette butts, pee on the floor, garbage everywhere, garbage cans overflowing. Keep in mind this is from my husband who really doesn't pay attention to these things that's how noticeable it was.

When we walked in, the hostess said it would be about a 45 minute wait, but she wasn't sure since some people had left without telling her. Looking around the restaurant, there were quiet a few empty tables, and there didn't seem to be too many people waiting, so I was slightly confused. But since we weren't in a rush or grungry (the anger of being overly hungry), we decided to wait.

Luckily, we had only been sitting outside for about 15 minutes when our name was called. The interior is super cute! I really liked the high ceilings and how bright the restaurant was. It was definitely the perfect atmosphere for a lazy Sunday brunch.

After much deliberation, we finally made our decisions and ordered.  I ordered the breakfast poutine and my fiance had the chx + toast (fried chicken strips, rosemary brioche french toast, and a blueberry syrup). My poutine was just okay. It was a solid portion, but kind of bland, and I definitely didn't see any cheese curds. On the other hand, my fiance loved his dish! I thought the different components sounded weird on paper, but once I had a bite, I was sold! The chicken was flavorful, and the rosemary french toast was the perfect savory accompaniment, but I do wish it was a little less soggy. However, I did think the chicken was on the dry side.

Although we didn't have room to sample their pastries, they all looked amazing. I will definitely be trying one on my next visit.

I think overall, I would give Prep & Pastry 3.5 stars, but I'm rounding it up to 4 since I think I would be happier if I got a different dish next time.

Caruso's is located on 4th Ave. so it's in an active environment that is fun.  They have indoor or outdoor seating available and both are enjoyable.  The Caruso special is always a delicious dinner (spaghetti, ravioli and meatballs).  Clams and Shrimp Adriatic is awesome with white sauce.  The lasagna is incredible.

First off, you go up to a counter to order, and the boy there didn't seem to understand what I was ordering. Then you move to the next person (like at chipotle) and they ask what you're ordering again... Because there's no communication between the team. (That be a great opportunity to upgrade without paying!) The result was, we ended up not getting some of our side orders. But you do pay at the end of the counter. Then we went to sit down and the tables were all dirty, so I grabbed napkins and some water to wipe off our own table quickly since it was the only one available. Then my partner went to grab some salsas. After she set her plate down, I went to grab some salsa and lime and napkins. The salsa bar was messy and in need of cleaning. And I should've heeded the warning of hot taco salsa, cuz the spicy one was so hot my mouth burned for 20 minutes, which surprised me cuz I like hot hot salsa. I had immediate heartburn too... Which I rarely get from spice. The tacos were OK I guess, I make better at home - - nothing to rave about and yes, they were SMALL street tacos. The black beans had a strange spice like rosemary or thyme and were underdone & not very edible. To top all this off, The interior atmosphere was loud crowded and noisy, I can't even tell you if they were playing music because I can barely hear my sweetie sitting across from me. Oh and it was lunchtime, not happy hour. When I got up to get my final refill of water and dump my tray, I finally saw a young man coming around cleaning with a cloth. He left the dirty cloth sitting by the edge of the salsa bar the whole time I was refilling my drink and my partners'. Then I saw him return to pick something up off the floor, and return to grabbing the cloth and wiping around the salsa bar. Later that day when I got home, both my partner and I both had stomach distress. I won't add anything else except I don't think I'm returning to this taco bar, especially because I agree with another review here: we live in a town with way too many good tacos to return to this mediocre taco bar.",2016-07-17 17:14:17,Street- Taco and Beer Co.,Tucson,AZ,4.5,805,"Mexican, Bars, Restaurants, Nightlife",467,3.7,35

On my 04/29/12 visit on a Sunday afternoon the atmosphere was nice, the service was great but my fish was incredibly bad.

I ordered the Tilapia Biance and with the first bite I knew it was off.  It tasted like it had been cooked in dirty coppery pasta water.  I ate the shrimp and the side portions but didn't touch the two pieces of fish.

When my waiter, who was very friendly and attentive, took the plate away he commented that I didn't touch the fish, and I said something to the effect of ""Ya, the fish was a little off today"".  I didn't make a fuss because I was with a party of friends.  I was suprised that he didn't offer an accomodation, as I clearly hadn't eatan a bite of the core portion of my $20.00 Entree.

When I got home in the evening I wrote the Manager and the Claim Jumper guest relations department of my problem and inputted my ticket number and server number, and contact information.

It has been a week now and no one has contacted me to respond to my concern.

I was relatively certain that someone would promptly respond and at the very least provide a gift certificate for a future visit or something.

This one is the older location, and it goes without saying to avoid this place at all cost. As an avid buffeter (yes I just made up the word), I came to this place a lot. Now that I've matured and actually want quality buffet (and other quality food served at sit-downs), this place was not of the first to get the axe of places to go.

If you are looking for a quiet meal, don't step inside this place. Kids run around screaming everywhere. Parents are loud and obnoxious (and sometimes borderline abusive to their kids), and many people are rude when trying to get the food on their plates.

When it comes to healthy food, I'm convinced all of Golden Corral is bad. I've observed, specifically at this location, items like the coleslaw, tuna salad, and potato salad coming out a can, the lettuce and spinach is never kept at a cool temperature, and the hot veggies (ie the carrots, the broccoli) taste like they came out a microwave. But that desert bar seems constantly well-maintained and every fried food available cooked fresh. In other words, the they successfully make healthy food taste so bad that that you get so angry and thus has to devour yourself in all it's high-calorie, heart-disease diabetic-causing food.

Customer service was not this location's specialty. I only had one good waiter who has been with the Golden Corral franchise since they had a location at 1st Ave and Wetmore. I always have an eye and an ear open on the employees. They have little interest in ensuring the customers are happy. Then again, some of the customers there are not worth giving good service to. I say this with the mindset that one of the problems in this country is that parents (and many individuals for that matter), don't care about what foods we are feeding ourselves and our children. Sorry for going off-topic.

To summarize, eating at this location is terrible. The new location on Thornydale has much better customer service and has a bigger selection of foods, including healthy options (still not the best, but better). In fact, i was at the other one recently and enjoyed it.

I am noticing a downward trend in Chipotle.  Perhaps I have bad luck, but they are becoming skimpier and skimpier on their portions.  Tonight, my Dad's burrito bowl barely had any meat in it and when we asked for more, the girl gave a little snarl behind the counter and tossed about 2 more tiny chunks of meat into the bowl.  I generally order the vegetarian burrito bowl (not because I am a vegetarian, but for some reason this is the yummiest option to me).  It used to be that when I ordered a vegetarian, they piled on the beans, however tonight was another example of their cutting back on portions.  I asked for some more beans and again, the snarl and curt small plop of beans in my bowl.  

When it came time for the cheese (one of my favorite parts) it was merely a sprinkle.  I remember the good old days when the cheese was piled high, in a beautiful mountain of cheesy deliciousness.  Not anymore though :(  however, I maybe should thank them for saving me the calories!

Finally, I requested my guac on the side -- no problem there until I went to pay.  He tried to charge me for the guac... very un-dude.   I nicely inquired/informed that it was included with my vegetarian bowl.  He removed the charge, but he didn't look too happy about it.  He almost made me feel as though I was stealing from them.

The restaurant itself is really nice, and ambiance is tasteful, the hostess was very courteous and greeted us with a beautiful smile, she first said there was a 20 minute wait time, so she said we could walk around downtown and she would text us when our table was ready; we thought that was awesome! we love walking around downtown! As we where walking out she came to get us and told us there was a cancelation and a table had opened up for us; we were thrilled! they walked us to a beautiful round table in front of a mezquite wall, and an impressive star chandelier above us; we loved it! We started looking over the menu, and a server came by to offer drinks; my husband and I got a beer each, my friend ordered the tequila flight ""special"" tablas style... whatever that meant; just translated to an overpriced shot of tequila, since the server explained that between the 1/3 shots it would only equal 1 full shot, for $22!!!! mind you, a bottle of patron silver at total wine is around $19... He didn't even explain the flight and the presentation; so, that was just bad. Then he came back and started explaining the specials, it was hard to hear him; the place was so noisy, so he had to explain once to them and then again to us. He offered a dinner for two special with a ribeye steak and black truffle french fries with some sort of a green chile bechamel, so my husband asks about the price he said $79 so we figured there would be big enough portions for the both of us; when the plate was served we were each given our own plate with a charbroiled green onion and a tortilla wrapped in tin foil. Lol. after that they put a plate in front of us with a single ribeye over the french fries and a fried egg on top. (I grew up in a steak house in the north of Mexico, and love a good steak) This steak was sub-par; nothing special and full of gristle... the fries were really soggy and I was so excited about the truffle because I love the flavor, unfortunately there was no truffle flavor to be found in the fries. At the end of the night food was edible, nothing impressive; what did impress me was the check; we paid $97 for a single steak french fries and a fried egg and a couple of beers!

The ambience is very nice, and the food was outstanding, if a little pricey. But for a local place, I won't take points away for the cost.

I was going to give Barrio four stars after our server told us the first item we ordered (the Totoi) was not available. It went to three stars when we found out a few minutes later that the beef spare rib was also not available. I think two stars is too low (I try to give benefit of the doubt), but I would put it at 2.5 stars after my fiance told me the women's restroom was out of toilet paper and hand soap. Plus, our server told us they were out of to-go boxes. How does that happen? Aren't those ordered by the hundreds (or at least dozens)? It was almost like the person who handle all the ordering of food and supplies had been out for the past couple weeks.

Our server was clearly busting her rear to handle the load, and it seemed like they were under-staffed for a weekend evening. A woman stopped by as we were getting ready to leave. We assume she was the manager or owner, but she didn't introduce herself. She just asked how things were. When my fiance explained that our first two dinner choices were not available, the woman brushed it off by saying they were a ""scratch-based"" restaurant. We're not sure what that means, but we assume it means they make meals from scratch. That's great, but it's not really an excuse. If there's such a strong chance you won't have two of the seven entrees on your menu, maybe you should make guests aware of that. No other effort was made to make up for this, and no serious apology came for this strange situation.

At some point the host staff appeared to be forewarning guests who came in the door that they advertised menu wasn't completely available. And definitely a few people walked back out. 

Ultimately, I would probably come back, but I might call ahead to ask what's actually available from the menu.

Speaking of bars, they have a chip and salsa bar, yum! Even raosted peppers to add on for free.
The drink assortment made me smile as I have cravings for pineapple fanta. They carry agua frescas and bottled mexican sodas (or pop where I am from).

The menu says it's Native American food, though the theme to many dishes seems pretty Mexican food like to me. But I don't care how they describe it because its so good.

Sure they have your normal eggs/pancakes/waffles diner type breakfasts, but then they also have a bunch of spicey interesting additions. My new favorite thing is the Green Corn Waffle, it's so good. It's a waffle with green corn, red and green chiles all in the batter. Then they top it with some cheese. Amazing.

Awful service.  Awful food.  Not worth the price. 

We had a party of 6 on a Saturday night. 

We had some tapas apps (which were meh) and ordered 2 chickens,  1 baby back rib, 1 spare rib, 1 enchilada  and 1 steak for entrees.  

After waiting an hour for our entrees, the waitress came back to tell us that they were out of the spare ribs. Ok, so we added another chicken request.  

And continued waiting........ Next, after another 30 minutes, the waitress came back to tell us that they were out of chicken and only had one order left!   Who runs out of chicken!  And, we needed 3 ... We should have left then.  But no... We subbed out for another steak and the tacos and stuck it out to the brutal end. Only to have cold food  and baby back ribs that tasted like boiled water. 

Bar service was even slower the entire evening  with us having to actually get up and go to the bar to get drinks ourselves because our waitress was MIA on refilling the cocktails.  Drinks were too small, too sweet and overpriced.

Only guy in the place working hard was the guy filling the water glasses.  Kudos to him. 

The owner was the biggest disappointment - at the end, she walks up and says "" we comped your bill for the baby back ribs because you didn't like them, right?""  No apology, no accountability, no nothing.

I had previously left a 5 star review exclaiming my love, but now after all the hype has died, I now feel the need to be honest. I could have totally gone on an off day today, but I feel a need to state my experience and my previous experiences that I've been ignoring.
Service was still tremendous as always, never a complaint there. They checked up regularly, which is always welcomed.
Atmosphere is always the lovely hipster, warm, country feel. Welcomed as well.
The food however, is where I've just got to be honest. I'm forever in love with their poutine which I found they only serve on weekends, so I was totally bummed today. Instead, I ordered The Bacon Lucy. While a great idea, I found the bun to be too dense. It had wonderful crisp edges, but was way too thick to enjoy a burger. The taste was okay. A little on the salty side, wouldn't recommend it to someone who has to watch their BP. Also, it kept falling apart and was hard to handle. The fries that accompanied were okay, limp, meh.
My husband ordered The Dip. We tried this the very first time we visited which was only a week or two after opening. We complained it was way too salty to eat and we were compted and given a free pastry. The situation was handled lovely. But unfortunately it was still salty and we won't be ordering it again. My husband still ate it all though because he was too hungry to complain. Plus, they really skimped on the meat. The first time we had it, it was full of meat and cheese but now it was pretty much all bread again like my burger and what meat was in there was salty as well as the au jus. I'm particular about my au jus and this is way too salty to dip in.
I ordered a mimosa for the first time today. A fuzzy navel. Our waiter fixed it and unfortunately did not know how to mix a mimosa. It was 98% champagne and barely any OJ and peach flavor. They threw in a little orange peel in the champagne too... Nice touch I guess.
To go we ordered our favorite maple bacon cronuts which have always blown us away and we were left with solid cronuts. No fluff, no flake, equivalent to a stress ball. We were totally sad.
I'm just really sad about my visit and we will continue to visit but with stretches of time in between.
One thing I want to comment on as well is that, I know that perfection takes time, but with the food we got and how long we waited, they really need to step that up. It wasn't even packed today and we still waited some good time. In the past, they've always given us free pastries for waiting so long (30-40min). No complaint there, lovely service like I've said. I will always wait for my poutine too, but ""prep"" still needs improvement.
I guess I'll have to settle for the super packed weekends and wait to have my delicious poutine.

Brunch- 3.5 stars.  I've been to brunch here maybe a dozen times.  The food itself is great.  My husband loves the Latin Poor Man's Omelette, and I adore the Pilgrim sandwich.  The bread is delicious and all the brunch food I've had has been great.  The service, however, is lacking.  Things are usually very slow and occasionally come out wrong.  The servers always act as if they are panicked and slammed even if there are few people there.

Dinner- 1 star.  They only serve dinner on Fridays.  After being there for brunch so many times, I was really excited to try their dinner menu.  We went on January 16th, 2015.  Unfortunately, it was perhaps the worst dining experience of my life.  I won't bore you with too many details, just the lowlights:
- Service was unbelievably slow.  The meal took 2.5 hours (this was just with appetizers and entrees).
- 15 minutes after my husband ordered his meal the waiter told him they were out, so he ordered something else.  His meal therefore showed up 10 minutes after everyone elses.
- One of the appetizers had grapes and many of the grapes had visible mold on them.  This was really unacceptable.
- The mussels I ordered were so cold I had to send them back.
I really hope it was just a bad night for the restaurant.  It was clear that every table was experiencing similar issues.  I've never seen so many tables of angry people.  The waiter did take the moldy appetizer off the bill, and offered us free dessert, but after such a terrible meal and being there for far longer than we planned, we passed.

I haven't been back since that disastrous dinner, not even for brunch.  Maybe I will someday, but for now I'd rather give my business to a restaurant that works hard to give their customers a pleasant experience.",2015-09-02 00:15:58,Ghini's French Caffe,Tucson,AZ,3.5,427,"Restaurants, Food, Breakfast & Brunch, Sandwiches, French, Bakeries, Salad",15,4.33,2

Go to Ghini's enough times and you will find out what's good, what's really good, and what is so-so.  I honestly would be disappointed if I drove from far away and expected Ghini's to be like France.

First of all, French coffee is one of the best things on this earth.  I ordered a coffee here one morning and it was $3 worth of grossness.  On the other hand, their ""herbal"" iced tea is fantastic - it is a hibiscus tea that tastes like a passion tea.

Their pastries from their in-house bakery are alright.  The creme brulee is pretty good, the breads are pretty good, and the tarts are good.  Overall, things are good but not the ""culinary ecstasy"" or ""piece of France"" that their web site suggests.

Sometimes their service is off, but they try hard.  I frequently get the wrong amount of change back after I pay at the cashiers.  I bike by sometimes and there are still diners lingering an hour after the restaurant is closed - really, people?  

Ghini's was one of the first restaurants I wanted to try when I first moved to Tucson.  I think what makes Ghini's unique is their infusion of spices like basil, thyme, and lavender.  However, this is not very hard to make at home - I just don't think it is worth $20 for a meal at Ghini's.

I was first introduced to this restaurant by my roommate (of Pakistani heritage) in grad school. The buffet is reasonably priced, and it's easy to stuff yourself full of spicy goodness if you've been living on ramen for a few days.
The buffet has a nice variety of dishes, including several without meat, at any given time. There's plenty of warm naan to soak up your leftover sauce, and when something runs out, the staff is quick to bring in more food. You may be a bit disappointed if you like things spicy, since they tend to prepare the buffet food on the milder side, but everything is still very good.

One noteworthy exception is an almost classy Chinese-restaurant-feeling burbling waterfall that you encounter upon entering.  After some admiration of the falls, you are led into a somewhat awkwardly arranged but not unpleasant dining area, flanked by the classic food troughs found in most buffet settings.

The food -- let's put this succinctly: nothing terrible, nothing spectacular -- unsurprisingly, most of the food fell squarely in the mediocre range.  What do you expect?  The ""sushi"" wasn't bad and they even had a pho station, something that I have not seen at a buffet like this, although the pho itself was definitely meh -- perhaps mostly because one gets the impression that despite its novelty, it is not that popular.  The dessert area was also notable, with some additions outside of the predictable drab Asian-buffet fare, but with also mediocre flavors and textures.  

The best part of the place was actually our bus boy/server, who was extremely attentive and was all about refilling drinks, bringing napkins and condiments.
